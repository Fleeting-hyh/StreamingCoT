The phone is displayed in a static position, showing the back with the MagSafe logo. The dense caption confirms that the phone is in a case, but it doesn't mention any rotation or angle changes. Since this is the first segment, there's no prior context to compare with. The question asks how long the phone remains in this state before being rotated. Given that the segment is only one second long and shows no rotation, it suggests that the static state continues beyond this frame. However, without additional segments, it's not possible to determine the exact duration from the provided information alone. Therefore, the best option is to consider that the information given does not match any of the provided durations.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "C"}
