This action is the first step in the sequence. The dense caption confirms that she is holding the bottle and pouring it onto the doll, which is consistent with the visual evidence. \n\nGiven the options, we need to determine the sequence of actions. The current segment shows the girl pouring powder onto the doll, which aligns with the first part of Option B: The little girl first pours white powder onto the doll...\n\nSince this is the first segment and no other actions have been observed yet, we can't confirm the entire sequence, but the initial action matches Option B.
