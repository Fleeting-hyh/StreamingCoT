The dense caption mentions the bat being placed on a metal bracket by the sink, indicating the start of the rinsing process. The question asks for the total number of times the water rinsing process is carried out on the bat throughout the video. Since this is the first segment and no prior context is available, we can only confirm the initial rinsing process.
