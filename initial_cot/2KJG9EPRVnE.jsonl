{"Timestamp": "1 second", "key_items": ["chef", "fish"], "explanation": "<think>\nAt  [0-1], the chef is seen preparing fish in a kitchen. He is wearing transparent gloves and is in front of a metal container filled with white flour. Next to the container is a red plastic basket full of fresh fish. The chef is coating a fish with flour, indicating the process of preparing the fish for cooking. \n\nGiven the options, we need to determine how many fish the chef coats with flour in one batch before arranging them on the griddle.
