This suggests that the stretching and release of water with foam began immediately or within the first second. Given the options, this aligns with the shortest time frame mentioned, which is 3 seconds. There is no indication of delay or extended time for the process to begin, and the dense caption confirms the action is occurring at the start of the segment.
