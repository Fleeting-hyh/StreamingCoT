He is looking down, preparing to strike the xylophone. This is the initial frame, so no strikes have occurred yet. Given the setup, it is likely that the man will start playing the xylophone soon. \n\nThere is no prior context or prior reasoning to consider yet, so we can only anticipate the next actions based on the setup. The question asks for the total number of times the xylophone is struck throughout the video. \n\nSince no strikes have occurred in this segment, we cannot eliminate any options at this point.
