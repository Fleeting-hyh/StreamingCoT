The video is starting, and no action has been taken yet. The question asks how often the man raises the card in his right hand first during the video. Since the video segment only shows the initial setup, there is no indication of any action taken yet. The man hasn't raised either card, so no options can be confirmed or eliminated based on this segment alone. Further observation is needed as the video progresses.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "B"}
