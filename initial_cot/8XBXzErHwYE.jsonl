This is the initial action observed in the video. Since the question asks about the number of times the women water their respective dirt pits, and this segment only shows planting, there is no watering action yet. The lower part of the screen shows the devil and Jesus arm wrestling, which is unrelated to the watering action. \n\nGiven that this is the first segment and no watering has occurred, we cannot determine the total number of times the women will water the pits. However, we can eliminate options that suggest a higher frequency based on this initial observation alone. The options provided are about the total count, and since no watering has been observed yet, we cannot confirm any specific number of times.\n\nTherefore, based on the current segment, we cannot definitively choose any of the options A, B, C, or D.
