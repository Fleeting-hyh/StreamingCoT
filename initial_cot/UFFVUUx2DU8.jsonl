The scene is dark with a bright light visible, indicating a concert setting. The text overlay suggests they are singing at the top of their lungs at a show. Since this is the first segment, there's no prior context to compare with. The women's hands are raised once in this frame, which aligns with the initial part of the question. There's no indication of a yellow light yet, so the count of hand raises is at least once. Given the limited information, Option A (Once) seems plausible, but more segments are needed to confirm if there are additional raises before the yellow light appears.\n</think>\n<answer>A</answer>", "answer": "B"}
