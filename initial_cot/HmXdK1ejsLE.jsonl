The caption mentions a white caption \"3\" in the middle of the screen, which might indicate a countdown or a timer. Given that the video is only one second long in this segment, it's likely that each emoji is highlighted for a short duration. \n\nConsidering the options, if each emoji were highlighted for thirty seconds (Option C), it would take much longer than the observed segment. Similarly, five seconds (Option A) would also be too long for such a short segment. Two seconds (Option B) might be plausible, but given the brevity of the segment, one second (Option D) seems more likely. \n\nTherefore, Option D is the most consistent with the observed duration of the segment.\n</think>\n<answer>D</answer>", "answer": "B"}
