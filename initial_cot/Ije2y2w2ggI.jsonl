This is the first instance of him speaking on stage. The presence of profile pictures at the bottom of the screen might indicate a show or interview setting, but there's no direct indication of prior speaking instances in this segment. Since there is no prior context or additional segments to reference, we can only confirm this single instance of speaking. Therefore, based on the current information, the man has spoken once so far.
