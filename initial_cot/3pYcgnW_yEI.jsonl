The dense caption mentions Jerry closing his eyes, but it does not specify any blinking. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context or additional segments to consider, I cannot confirm any blinking actions from previous segments. The question asks how many times Jerry blinks his eyes throughout the entire video, but based on the information available in this segment, there is no mention or indication of blinking.\n\nGiven the options, I need to consider the possibility that Jerry might blink in subsequent segments.
