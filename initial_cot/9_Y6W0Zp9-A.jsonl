He stabs the glove with the pencil, and the liquid flows out. This is the first instance of the glove being stabbed. The dense caption confirms the action of stabbing and the liquid flowing out. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we can only confirm that the liquid flows out at least once. There is no indication yet of how many times the liquid does not flow out. \n\nGiven the options, we need to observe further segments to determine the correct answer.
