The dense caption mentions a glass of yellow liquid drink, fries, and sauce packets on a bamboo mat, suggesting these items are part of the scene.\n\nSince this is the first segment, there's no prior context to compare with. The question asks how many times the man reveals an object by lifting or opening a container. In this segment, we see the hand holding a cup, which might be one instance of revealing an object by lifting.\n\nWithout more segments to analyze, we can't confirm the total count.
