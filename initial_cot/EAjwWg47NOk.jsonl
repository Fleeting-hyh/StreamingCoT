The mother is wearing funny glasses and a white top, while the boy is in a blue top. There is no visible interaction with a cockroach in this segment. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context or interactions with a cockroach mentioned, we cannot determine any successful swats or interactions yet. The question asks for the total number of successful interactions throughout the video, but we only have information for the first second. \n\nGiven that no interactions have occurred in this segment, we cannot eliminate any options based on this information alone.
