The question asks how long the man in the middle keeps his eyes closed from the start of the video. Given that this is the first segment and there is no indication of the man opening his eyes yet, it suggests that the time frame is at least 1 second. However, without further segments showing when he opens his eyes, it's not possible to determine the exact duration beyond this initial observation.\n</think>\n<answer>C</answer>", "answer": "C"}
