The woman is wearing a green T-shirt, and the man is wearing a yellow T-shirt. Both have a set of knives and forks in front of them. They clench their fists on the table, indicating anticipation or readiness. \n\nGiven the options, we need to determine the final composition of the food items in their bowls by the end of the video. Since this is the first segment and there is no prior context or actions indicating any change to the food items yet, we can't confirm the final composition based solely on this segment. However, the initial setup shows both having pasta.\n\nTo narrow down options, we observe that:\n- Option A suggests the man has pasta and chili peppers, and the woman has sausages.\n- Option B suggests the man has only chili peppers, and the woman has pasta and sausages.\n- Option C suggests the man has pasta and vegetables, and the woman has sausages and chili peppers.\n- Option D suggests the man has pasta and sausages, and the woman has chili peppers.\n\nSince we only see pasta initially, none of the options can be confirmed yet.
