The Iron Man figure is standing on a blue stand. There is no collision or creation of new figures in this segment. Since this is the first segment and no prior context is available, we cannot determine any collisions or new figures created yet. The question asks about the total number of new figures created as a result of collisions throughout the entire video, but with only this segment, no collisions or new figures are observed.
