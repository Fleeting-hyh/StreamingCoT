This suggests a stage of dough preparation. The presence of a metal noodle press indicates that the dough is being prepared for the next stage, likely shaping or pressing into noodles. \n\nGiven the limited context from this segment, we can identify at least two stages: kneading the dough and preparing to press it. However, without additional segments showing other stages like mixing ingredients, cutting noodles, or drying, it's challenging to determine the total number of stages.\n\nOption B (Two distinct stages can be identified in the noodle-making process.) seems plausible based on the current segment.
