This is the initial step in the process. Since the video only shows the beginning of the process, we can't determine the exact duration yet. However, the question asks for the total time from sugar pouring to the finished cotton candy. Given the options, we need to consider the typical time it takes to make cotton candy, which is usually around 30-45 seconds. Option C (30 seconds) seems plausible for a quick process, but without seeing the entire sequence, it's hard to confirm.
