There are also other animal-shaped cotton candies visible in the background, including a blue and a pink one. This suggests that multiple types of animal-shaped cotton candies are present. However, only the yellow cat-shaped cotton candy is being held above the water in this segment. \n\nSince the question asks how many types of animal-shaped cotton candies were dissolved in water, and only one type (the yellow cat) is shown being dissolved in this segment, we need to consider if more types are dissolved in subsequent segments. Without additional segments showing more cotton candies being dissolved, we can only confirm the yellow cat-shaped cotton candy.\n\nGiven the options, we need to determine if the current evidence supports any of them.
