Its eyes are looking towards the left side of the frame. There is no indication of movement in this segment. Since this is the first segment and there is no prior context or movement observed, we cannot determine any movement yet. The question asks how many times the monster moves in the video, but based on the current segment alone, there is no movement to count. Therefore, we cannot eliminate any options at this point.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "A"}
