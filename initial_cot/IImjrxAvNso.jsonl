The panda has its hands clasped together, and the little girl is holding out her hands with palms up. There are no eye-opening actions observed in this segment. Since this is the first segment and no prior context is available, we cannot determine any eye-opening actions yet. The question asks about the total number of eye-opening actions throughout the video, but with only this segment, we cannot confirm any actions.
