There is no indication of any change to the device on the tractor's back within this segment. The dense caption confirms that the tractor is equipped with speakers, but there is no mention of any change or removal of the device. Since this is the first segment and there is no prior context indicating any changes, the device on the tractor's back remains the same throughout this segment.
