The background is blue-gray and white. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context or additional frames to analyze, we cannot determine the exact time it takes for the man to consume the candies. The dense caption only describes the initial action of taking a candy, not the consumption process or its duration.\n\nGiven the lack of information about the time taken to consume the candies, we cannot accurately choose between the options provided.
