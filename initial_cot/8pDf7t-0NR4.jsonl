The text on the screen indicates a humorous context, When you get punished.This suggests that the boy is engaging in a playful or humorous activity. There is another person partially visible, likely also participating in the dance. \n\nGiven the question about how many people perform the arm-swinging dance, we need to consider the visible participants. The dense caption confirms the presence of at least two people: the boy and another individual whose back is visible. \n\nSince the video only shows these two individuals performing the dance, we can eliminate options that suggest more than two people are involved. Options C and D can be ruled out because they suggest more participants than observed. Option B is also unlikely as it suggests three people, which is not supported by the current segment. \n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is Option A, which states that two people perform the arm-swinging dance.\n</think>\n<answer>A</answer>", "answer": "B"}
