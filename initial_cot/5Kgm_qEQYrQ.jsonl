The dense caption indicates the bear's interaction with the box door, but there is no mention of any rotations or actions performed by a little girl. Since the question is about the little girl's rotations with the box door, and there is no indication of her presence or actions in this segment, it suggests that the relevant actions might not have occurred yet or are not depicted in this segment. Given the lack of information about the little girl's actions, it is not possible to determine the number of rotations she performed based on this segment alone.
