The vampire's power is displayed in red with only one bar, while the man's power is full and displayed in green. This suggests that the vampire man is low on energy. The man in the blue jacket is holding a bag of snacks, which might indicate an interaction where energy could be transferred. However, there is no direct indication in this segment that the vampire man absorbs energy from the man in the blue jacket. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we cannot confirm any energy absorption yet.
