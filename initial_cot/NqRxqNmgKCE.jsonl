There are no railroad crossing signs visible in this frame. The scene is static, with no changes or movements occurring. \n\nGiven the question about the number of distinct railroad crossing signs and their changes, this segment does not introduce any signs. The options provided all mention specific signs and their transformations, but none of these are observed here. \n\nSince no signs are introduced in this segment, we cannot confirm any of the options A, B, C, or D, which all describe the appearance and changes of railroad crossing signs.
