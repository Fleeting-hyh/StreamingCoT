There is no interaction with the red character observed in this segment. The red character, described in the dense caption, is not shown interacting with other characters in this frame. This suggests that any interaction would need to be confirmed in subsequent segments. \n\nSince there is no prior context or interactions observed yet, I cannot confirm any direct interactions at this point.
