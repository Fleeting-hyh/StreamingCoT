This indicates that the object is being crushed or deformed. Given that this is the first segment, and there is no prior context of other objects being crushed, we can confirm that at least one object has been deformed by the foot. \n\nSince the question asks for the total number of different objects crushed or deformed throughout the video, and this segment shows the first instance, we need to consider if there are more objects in subsequent segments. However, based solely on this segment, we can only confirm one object. \n\nGiven the options, none of them indicate only one object, so the answer must consider future segments for the total count.
