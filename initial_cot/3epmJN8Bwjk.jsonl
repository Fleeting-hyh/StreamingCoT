She appears to be preparing to roll it. The table in front of her has six different items, each numbered from 1 to 6. The items include stacks of 50 and 100 euro bills, chocolate bars, a box of chocolate beans, a giant lollipop, and an Easter egg toy. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context, I cannot determine any expressions of disappointment yet. The woman seems excited and ready to roll the dice, indicating anticipation rather than disappointment. \n\nGiven that the question asks how many times she expresses disappointment throughout the video, and this segment only shows her initial action, I cannot confirm any instances of disappointment here. Therefore, I cannot eliminate any options based on this segment alone.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "D"}
