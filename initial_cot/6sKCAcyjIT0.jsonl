This aligns with the initial step described in Option C. Following this, the handle appears to slide onto the metal plate, which is the next step in Option C. The handle then moves down to enclose the metal plate, which is consistent with the third step in Option C. Finally, the wooden pieces come together, and the wood on the right moves left and right a few times, matching the final step in Option C. \n\nOther options do not match the observed sequence. Option A involves the metal block rotating and the handle rising vertically, which is not observed. Option B mentions the wooden pieces sliding apart dramatically, which is not the case. Option D describes the handle moving to the right and retracting, which does not align with the video.
