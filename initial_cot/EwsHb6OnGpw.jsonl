The mallets have black handles and white heads. This is the first segment, so there are no prior observations to compare with. The question asks about the number of different types of mallet head colors used throughout the video. Since only one color (white) is observed in this segment, we cannot determine the total number yet. However, we can eliminate options that suggest more than one color is used based on this initial observation.
