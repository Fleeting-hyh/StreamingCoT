The ingredients on the cutting board include slices of ham. The man is looking at his phone, not interacting with the sandwich ingredients. The focus is on the woman preparing the sandwiches. \n\nSince this is the beginning of the video, no sandwiches have been completed yet. The question asks about the number of ham slices in the sandwiches on the left and right throughout the video.
