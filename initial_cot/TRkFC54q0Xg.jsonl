This is the first action in the sequence. The dense caption mentions her wearing a black jacket, jeans, and a helmet, which suggests she is preparing to ride. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we can only confirm the initial action of walking towards the motorcycle. The question asks for the total number of distinct actions before riding away, but we only have information about the first action here. \n\nGiven the options, we cannot yet determine the total number of actions, but we can eliminate options that suggest a higher number of actions than observed so far.
