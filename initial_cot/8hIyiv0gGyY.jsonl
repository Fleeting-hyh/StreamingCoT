This is the first time he performs this action in the video. The man in white sportswear is standing beside him, and they are both on an indoor soccer field. The background shows other individuals, but they are not interacting with the ball. Since this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we can only confirm one flick at this point. The options suggest multiple flicks, but without further segments, we cannot confirm the total number.
