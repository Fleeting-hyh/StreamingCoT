The lady in the blue dress is on the left, and the lady in the yellow T-shirt and ripped jeans is on the right. They appear to be talking and gesturing. There is no indication yet of anyone entering the wardrobe. \n\nSince this is the beginning of the video, there is no prior context to draw from. The question asks how many people ultimately enter the wardrobe by the end of the video. Based on the current segment, no one has entered the wardrobe yet. \n\nGiven the options, we need to consider the possibility of more people entering the wardrobe as the video progresses. However, with only this initial segment, we cannot confirm the final count. The dense caption does not provide information about future actions, so we must rely on the visual content.\n\nOption Z (\no right option) might be considered if the video does not provide enough information to determine the final count.
