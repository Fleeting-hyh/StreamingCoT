After checking torque settings, a common next step would be to adjust the bolts accordingly. \n\nOptions A and C are unrelated to mechanical adjustments, so they can be eliminated. Option D suggests loosening bolts, which is less likely after checking torque settings unless there's a specific reason to do so.
