There is no direct interaction with the women in this segment. The dense caption mentions that two women are standing in front of them, but there is no indication of any interaction between the men and the women in this specific frame. \n\nSince there is no prior context or previous segments to refer to, we cannot confirm any interactions from earlier parts of the video. The question asks how many times the two men interact directly with the women during the video. Based on the current segment alone, there is no interaction observed.\n\nGiven the options, we need to consider that the current segment does not show any interaction, so we cannot confirm any of the specific interaction counts (A, B, C, or D) based solely on this segment.
