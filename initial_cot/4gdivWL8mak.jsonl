This suggests she might be using the curling iron on her tongue. The background is blue-purple, and she is wearing blue and yellow striped pajamas. There is no indication of another woman cooking in this segment. Since the video only shows the initial action, it's unclear how long she holds the curling iron. The options provided are about the duration, but without seeing the full action, it's hard to determine the exact time.
