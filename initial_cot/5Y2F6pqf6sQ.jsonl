He is in the process of removing the cloth from the tofu. This action is the first step in the sequence of preparing the tofu for the customer.

However, the dense caption does not provide enough detail to confirm the subsequent steps beyond removing the cloth. \n\nOption B suggests wrapping the tofu in paper and handing it over directly, which is less likely given the typical street food preparation process. Option C involves dicing into small cubes and placing them in a plastic bag, which is not indicated in the current segment. Option D involves slicing into several pieces and placing them on a tray, which also isn't confirmed.\n\nSince the dense caption only confirms the initial action of removing the cloth, and the subsequent steps are not detailed, Option Z (\no right option) might be considered if the video does not provide enough information to confirm the full sequence.
