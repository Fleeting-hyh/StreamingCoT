He is sitting in a room with a white wall and beige roller blinds behind him. The balloon is in his hand, indicating he might be about to blow into it. There is no indication of helium or any tools like a pin, which eliminates options B and C. The man's posture and the presence of the balloon suggest he is about to inflate it, aligning with option A. There is no visible frustration or unusual reaction yet, so option D is less likely.
