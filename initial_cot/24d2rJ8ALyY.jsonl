This action is the first interaction with the engine in the video. The dense caption mentions the hand moving out of the frame after adjusting the screw, indicating a single action. There is no mention or visual indication of the engine handle being pulled in this segment. Since this is the first segment and no prior context is available, we can only confirm one interaction with the engine, which is the adjustment of the screw, not the pulling of a handle. Therefore, based on the current segment, the engine handle has not been pulled at all.
