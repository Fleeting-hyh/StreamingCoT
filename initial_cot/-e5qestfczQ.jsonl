The scene appears stable with no visual effects like shaking, zooming, blurring, or fading. The dense caption mentions a soldier in uniform, but there's no indication of any recurring visual effect yet. Since the question asks about a recurring effect after an explosion, and no explosion or subsequent effects are observed in this segment, we can't confirm any options yet. However, the absence of any visual disturbance suggests that if an explosion were to occur, we would need to see its effects in subsequent frames to determine the correct option.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "A"}
