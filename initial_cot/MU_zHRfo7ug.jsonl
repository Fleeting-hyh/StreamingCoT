The background shows various art supplies, including a small drawing board, a palette, and a pot of green plants. This suggests that the card is being presented or manipulated in some way. Since this is the first segment, there are no prior actions involving cards to compare with. The question asks about different action stages involving cards being manipulated or altered. Given that this is the initial segment, we can only confirm one action stage so far. However, the options provided suggest multiple stages, so we need to consider the possibility of more actions in subsequent segments.
