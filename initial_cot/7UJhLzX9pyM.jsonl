The balloon is decorated with painted eyes and a mouth. A transparent bowl is placed beneath the balloon. This is the only balloon shown in the current segment. Since no other balloons are visible in this segment, we can only confirm the presence of one color, which is blue. The question asks how many different colors of balloons are shown in the video. Given that only one color is visible in this segment, and there is no prior context indicating other colors, the answer must be based on the information available.
