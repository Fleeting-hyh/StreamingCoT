The man on the right is holding the cat's paws and pressing down on its body, which suggests the cat is being restrained. The cat's position and the man's actions imply some resistance or struggle from the cat, as the man is actively managing the cat's movements.\n\nGiven this is the first segment, we have no prior context or previous counts of resistance. The description indicates that the cat is being held down, which suggests at least one instance of resistance or struggle in this segment.
