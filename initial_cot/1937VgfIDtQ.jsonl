However, there is no indication in this segment of any transformation of the lipstick itself, such as mixing with lotion, water, or oil, or any change in its state to a jelly, ice, or gel.\n\nGiven the lack of visible transformation in this segment, it's difficult to determine the final state of the lipstick.

Therefore, without additional context or visual evidence of the lipstick being altered, it's challenging to confirm any of the specific transformations described in the options.\n\nOption Z (\no right option) might be considered if no transformation is shown, but since the question implies a transformation occurs, we need to rely on the given options and the limited information available.
