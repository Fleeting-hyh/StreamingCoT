The man in the black top is jumping over a row of green boxes. This suggests that the man in the orange top is watching the action rather than actively participating in overcoming obstacles at this moment. \n\nGiven the context of the question, which asks about the predominant method used by the man in the orange top to overcome obstacles across different levels, we need to consider the options provided. The current segment does not show the man in the orange top using any tech gadgets, physical strength, stealth, or creative solutions. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we cannot yet determine the predominant method. However, the presence of the man in the orange top at the doorway suggests he might be observing or waiting for his turn, which could imply a more strategic or collaborative approach.\n\nOption D mentions creative solutions such as kicking boxes and collaborating, which could align with the observed setup of the green boxes. However, without further evidence, it's premature to confirm this.\n\nOption Z (\no right option) is a possibility if the subsequent segments do not provide enough evidence to support any of the other options.\n\nGiven the limited information in this segment, we cannot definitively eliminate any options.
