This is the first appearance of the blue light effect in the video. Since there is no prior context or previous segments to refer to, we can only confirm that the blue light effect appears at least for the duration of this segment, which is 1 second. \n\nGiven the options, we need to determine the total duration of the blue light effect throughout the entire video. Since we only have information about the first second, we cannot yet confirm the total duration. However, we can eliminate options that do not align with the initial observation. \n\nOption D (\"The blue light effect appears for a total of 10 seconds\") seems too short based on the initial appearance, but without more context, it's hard to confirm. Options A, B, and C suggest longer durations, but we need more information to determine the correct total duration. \n\nSince we only have the first second, we cannot definitively choose an option yet.
