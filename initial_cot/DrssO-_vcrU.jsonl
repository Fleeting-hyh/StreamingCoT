Given the question about the duration of the transformation before his entire back turns green, we need to consider the typical pace of such transformations in similar contexts. \n\nSince the video segment provided is only one second long, and the transformation process is not yet complete, we can infer that the transformation continues beyond this frame. The options suggest different durations, and without seeing the entire transformation, we rely on the typical length of such effects in media. \n\nOption C suggests a very short duration, which seems unlikely for a full transformation.
