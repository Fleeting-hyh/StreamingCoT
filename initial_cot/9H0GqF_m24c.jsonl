The dense caption mentions that there are two pieces of cardboard inside the white paper cups, but it does not mention any red light activation. \n\nSince there is no mention of a red light in the dense caption and no visible indication of a red light in the provided frame, it suggests that the red light does not activate during this interaction. \n\nGiven the options, the red light activating once, twice, three times, or four times cannot be confirmed based on the current segment.
