The dense caption mentions a brown object, white trash, bricks, and a blue cloth, but these details do not relate to the action of picking up a puppy. \n\nSince there is no prior context or previous segments to refer to, we cannot determine how many times a puppy has been picked up in earlier parts of the video.
