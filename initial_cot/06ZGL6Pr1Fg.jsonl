However, the setup suggests that the video is about to transition into capturing these poses. \n\nSince the current segment only shows preparation, it doesn't directly answer the question about the number of poses or their characteristics. The dense caption mentions two baby photos with captions What I want to poseand What I get,which implies a comparison between intended and actual poses. This suggests that the video will show multiple attempts at posing the baby, aligning with the idea of capturing different poses.\n\nBased on the options provided, the final pose is described as having specific characteristics like the baby's arms or legs bent and the cheek resting on a hand or shoulder. Without visual evidence of the poses in this segment, we rely on the context and the setup to infer that multiple poses will be attempted, and the final pose will have distinct features.\n\nOption C states that three different poses are captured, with the final pose having the baby's arms bent and its cheek resting on its hand.
