The focus is on the two individuals holding dumbbells and apples. Since there is no red cross displayed in this segment, we can infer that the red cross has not appeared yet. \n\nGiven that there is no prior context or previous segments to refer to, we cannot determine how many times the red cross has appeared before this segment. However, based on the current segment alone, the TV monitor does not show a red cross.\n\nSince the question asks how many times the TV monitor shows a red cross during the video, and we have no evidence of any red crosses in this segment, we cannot confirm any of the options A, B, C, or D.
