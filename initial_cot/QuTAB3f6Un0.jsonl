The man stretching is actively dodging the spear, indicating a defensive action. \n\nGiven the single frame and the context provided, it is clear that the man in the red tracksuit dodges the spear at least once. However, without additional frames or context, it is challenging to determine the exact number of dodges. The dense caption suggests a single instance, but more frames would be needed to confirm the total number.\n\nBased on the available information, it seems unlikely that the man dodges multiple times within this short segment. Therefore, the options suggesting multiple dodges (A, B, C, D) may not be accurate.
