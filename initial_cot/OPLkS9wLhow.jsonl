There is no visible effect such as smoke or an object moving towards him in this frame. The caption mentions Top5and Experiment,but no activation of a device is observed here. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context or previous segments to compare with, we cannot determine any previous activations. The question asks for the number of times a device is activated with a visible effect throughout the video. \n\nGiven that no activation is observed in this segment, we cannot confirm any of the options yet.
