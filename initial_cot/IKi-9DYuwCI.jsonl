The text overlay mentions opening the sink drain, indicating the water is flowing. The ducklings are positioned close to the drain, suggesting they are interacting with the water as it flows down. The dense caption confirms there are three ducklings in the sink. This aligns with the question about how many ducklings are interacting with the water during its flow down the drain. Since all three ducklings are near the drain, it supports the idea that all three are attempting to interact with the water.
