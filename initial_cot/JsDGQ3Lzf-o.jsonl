The scene shows no movement from the cat, indicating it is still lying down. The Japanese subtitle mentions a movement that is always seen, suggesting the cat might start moving soon. However, within this segment, the cat remains still. \n\nGiven the options, we need to determine how long the cat remains lying before it starts to wriggle. Since the cat is still in this segment, we need to consider the duration of the entire video to determine the correct option. The options suggest different time frames, and without further movement in this segment, we cannot confirm the exact time yet. \n\nOption C suggests 3 seconds, which is the shortest time frame. If the cat starts to wriggle shortly after this segment, Option C could be correct.
