At [15-19], golden powder was added to the mortar, which contained yellow powder, crushed golden balls, golden long strips, golden round sequins, golden-yellow granular objects, and golden glitter. At [12-15], golden-yellow granular objects were added to the mortar, which contained yellow powder, crushed golden balls, golden long strips, golden round sequins, and golden glitter. At [9-12], golden round sequins were added to the mortar containing yellow powder, crushed golden balls, golden long strips, and golden glitter. At [6-9], golden long strips were added to the mortar containing yellow powder, crushed golden balls, and golden glitter. At [3-6], golden balls were added to the mortar containing yellow powder and golden glitter. At [1-3], a yellow rectangular object was ground into powder, and a golden rectangular object was placed into the mortar. This suggests that there are at least ten different types of golden materials added: golden rectangular object, yellow rectangular object, golden balls, golden long strips, golden round sequins, golden-yellow granular objects, golden powder, thin golden sheet, golden glitter, and the golden viscous substance.
