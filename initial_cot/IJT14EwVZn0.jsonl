There is no mention or visual indication of a wooden chest being placed in this segment. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context or previous segments to refer to, we cannot determine any actions related to placing a wooden chest. The question asks how many times a wooden chest was placed, but based on the current segment alone, no chest has been placed yet.\n\nGiven the lack of information about chest placements in this segment, we cannot eliminate any options based on the current evidence.
