This is the initial step of scooping the liquid into the circular device. The dense caption mentions a transparent object inside the basket, which aligns with the process of forming a film. \n\nTo determine the total time, we need to observe the subsequent steps: scooping the liquid, forming the film, and removing it from the device in clean water. The dense caption only covers the first second, so we need to consider the entire process based on the video.\n\nGiven the options, we need to estimate the time it takes for the entire process. The options range from 12 to 18 seconds. Since the dense caption only covers the first second, we need to infer the remaining time based on typical process durations for similar activities.\n\nOption B (\"12 seconds\") seems plausible if the process is quick, but without seeing the entire sequence, it's hard to confirm.
