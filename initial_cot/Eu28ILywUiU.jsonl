The girl on the right is holding up a finger to her forehead, suggesting they are about to measure or demonstrate something related to the forehead. The text on the screen asks, How many fingers take up our forehead's?with a laughing and crying emoji, indicating a playful or humorous context. \n\nSince this is the first segment and no actual measurement results are shown, we can't determine the pattern yet.
