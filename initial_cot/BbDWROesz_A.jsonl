The bottle of strawberry jam is already placed on the snow with its cap open. The background shows a snowy landscape with trees and a clear sky. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we can only analyze the actions described here. The hand performs the action of inserting the ice cream cone into the snow. There is no mention of picking up the strawberry jam or presenting a completed snow ice cream cone in this segment. \n\nGiven the limited information, we cannot determine the total number of distinct actions performed by the gloved hand from picking up the strawberry jam to presenting the completed snow ice cream cone.
