{"Timestamp": "1 second", "key_items": ["herd of black goats", "narrow wooden plank"], "explanation": "<think>\nAt  [0-1], a herd of black goats is seen crossing a river on a narrow wooden plank. One goat is about to reach the other side, while the rest are lined up, carefully walking on the plank. This indicates that the goats are crossing one after another in a sequence.
