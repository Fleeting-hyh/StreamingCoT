The numbers 1to 5are displayed, suggesting a sequence or challenge. This indicates the start of an activity involving breaking plastic wrap. Since only one person is shown in this segment, it suggests that the first person has successfully broken the plastic wrap. There is no indication of other people or additional actions in this segment, so it's reasonable to assume only one person has completed the task so far.
