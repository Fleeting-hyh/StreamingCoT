This indicates the parrot is in the very early stages of development. Since the question asks how many days it took for the parrot to develop fully blue feathers, and the current segment only shows the parrot at one day old, we need to consider the options provided. \n\nGiven that the parrot is only one day old in this segment, it is too early to determine the full development timeline. The options provided are specific time frames (seven days, five days, ten days, three days), but without further information on the parrot's development in subsequent segments, it is impossible to confirm any of these options. \n\nTherefore, based on the current segment alone, there is no sufficient evidence to choose any of the specific time frame options.
