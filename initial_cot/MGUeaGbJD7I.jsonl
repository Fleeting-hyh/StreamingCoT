This is the first object being destroyed by the press in the video. Since there is no prior context or additional objects mentioned in this segment, we can only confirm that crayons are being destroyed. The question asks how many different types of objects are destroyed, and based on this segment alone, we only see one type of object being destroyed. Without additional segments showing other objects, we cannot confirm any other types of objects being destroyed. Therefore, the options that suggest more than one type of object (A, B, D) cannot be confirmed with the current information.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "A"}
