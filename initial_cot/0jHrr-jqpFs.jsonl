The woman's actions of closing the door and celebrating further imply that the time has not changed since the man left.\n\nSince the time remains \"7:00\" in both segments, there has been no change in the time displayed. This confirms that the time has not changed yet, and we need to continue observing further segments to determine the total number of changes.\n\nGiven the current information, none of the options A, B, C, or D can be confirmed as correct because the time has not changed.
