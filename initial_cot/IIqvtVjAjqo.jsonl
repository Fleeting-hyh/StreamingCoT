The man is shirtless, wearing gray trousers and black socks, while the woman is in a black bra and olive-green trousers.

The woman puts on a white cropped sweater and later a black suit jacket. They end with the man holding a black backpack and the woman a brown handbag.\n\nOption C suggests the man puts on a white dress shirt, then a black sweater, and later a gray suit jacket.
