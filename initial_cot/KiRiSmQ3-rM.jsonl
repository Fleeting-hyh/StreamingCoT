The scene suggests they might be preparing to pop the balloons. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no indication of any balloons being popped yet, we can infer that the action of popping balloons has not occurred in this segment. The question asks how many times the twin men pop balloons during the video, and based on this initial segment, no balloons have been popped yet. \n\nGiven that the dense caption mentions the presence of balloons but not their popping, we can eliminate options that suggest any balloons have been popped in this segment.
