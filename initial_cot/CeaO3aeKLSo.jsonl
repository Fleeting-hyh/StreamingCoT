Iron Man is raising both hands to the right, while Spider-Man and Captain America have their hands on their knees. This is the first observed position for all three characters. There are no changes in position or orientation noted within this segment. Since there are no prior segments to compare with, we cannot yet determine how many times they change their positions. The dense caption confirms their initial setup but does not indicate any movement or change yet.

Earlier, at [0-1], Iron Man was raising both hands to the right while Spider-Man and Captain America had their hands on their knees. This indicates that Iron Man has changed his position or orientation in this segment. However, there are no mentions of Spider-Man or Captain America changing their positions or orientations in this segment. Therefore, we can confirm that Iron Man has changed his position once. \n\nSince we only have information about Iron Man changing position in this segment, we can't confirm any changes for Spider-Man or Captain America. The options provided suggest multiple changes for all three characters, but based on the observed movements, we don't have enough evidence to support the specific counts in options A, B, C, or D.
