This indicates that sponges are one of the materials being processed. The background includes a red lightning bolt symbol, but this doesn't affect the material identification. \n\nSince this is the first segment and no other materials have been shown or mentioned, we can only confirm sponges as a processed material so far. The question asks about the total number of different materials processed throughout the video, but with only sponges identified in this segment, we cannot yet determine the full scope. \n\nGiven the options, we need to consider that more materials might be introduced in subsequent segments.
