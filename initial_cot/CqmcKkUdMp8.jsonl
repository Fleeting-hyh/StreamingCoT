The woman is standing next to him, observing. The scene is indoors, and there is no indication of the lid being closed more than once in this segment. Since the question asks how many times the man closes the lid before the scene switches to outdoors, and there is no mention of the scene changing in this segment, we can only confirm one closure here. Without additional segments showing more closures, we cannot confirm any of the options A, B, C, or D.
