The dense caption confirms the elephant is inside the truck at this moment. Since the elephant hasn't exited yet, we can't determine the duration of contact with the truck. The question asks about the time the elephant stays in contact with the truck after exiting, so we need to observe subsequent frames to see when the elephant exits and how long it remains in contact.
