Spiderman is sitting under the table, holding a red tube connected to the cup. This suggests that Spiderman is using the tube to interact with the cola in the cup. Given the setup, it's likely that Spiderman is either blowing into the tube or drinking from it. \n\nOption A suggests creating bubbles by blowing into the tube, which is plausible given the setup. Option B suggests spraying the cola, which would require more force and isn't indicated here. Option C suggests filling the cup, but the cup is already being filled by Hulk.
