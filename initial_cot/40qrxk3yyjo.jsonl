There is no indication of any goalkeeping action or a soccer ball being kicked towards a goal. The scene primarily shows Ronaldo and other individuals on the field, but no goal attempts are visible.\n\nSince there is no action related to a goalkeeper saving or missing a soccer ball in this segment, we cannot determine any instances of a missed save. The question asks about the number of times the goalkeeper fails to save a ball, but the current segment does not provide any relevant information to answer this.\n\nGiven that there is no evidence of any goalkeeping action in this segment, we cannot eliminate any options based on this segment alone.
