{"Timestamp": "1 second", "key_items": ["boy in the red sweatshirt,yellow strings"], "explanation": "<think>\nAt [0-1], the boy in the red sweatshirt is squatting inside the cardboard box, reaching out to pull the yellow strings. There are four people standing behind the box, each with a yellow string tied to their nose. The boy appears to be pulling on these strings. \n\nGiven the setup, it seems likely that the boy could pull the strings from all four people standing behind the box. The dense caption mentions that there are yellow strings dangling in front of him, which suggests he has access to pull them. \n\nSince the question asks how many people had their yellow strings pulled off, and there are four people with strings, it is reasonable to conclude that the boy could pull all four strings. \n\nOption A (\"Five people had their yellow strings pulled off\") is not possible because there are only four people with strings. Option B (\"Three people had their yellow strings pulled off\") and Option C (\"Two people had their yellow strings pulled off\") are less likely given the setup.
