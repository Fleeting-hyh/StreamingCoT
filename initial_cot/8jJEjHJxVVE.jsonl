Each container has a tube in it, and the individuals are holding the tubes.

Without seeing their reactions in this segment, we cannot determine the number of individuals showing a pained expression yet. \n\nOptions C and Z can be eliminated because there are only four individuals, and the question does not suggest an incorrect option.
