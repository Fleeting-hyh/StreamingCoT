This indicates the beginning of the transformation or manipulation process. Since the dense caption mentions the hand model being printed, it suggests that the transformation is ongoing. However, without additional frames or context, it's unclear how long the entire process takes. The options provided suggest a range of times, but with only one second of video shown, it's not possible to determine the exact duration of the transformation.
