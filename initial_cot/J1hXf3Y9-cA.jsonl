The scene shows a barrier that might be a gate or door, but there is no indication of any attempt to open it or any failure to pass through it in this segment. The background includes a fence, wall, trees, and a blue sky, but these details do not directly relate to the question about opening a door.\n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context or indication of any attempts to open a door, we cannot confirm any attempts or failures yet. The question asks about the number of times individuals attempt to open a door but initially fail before managing to pass through it. Given that no such action is observed in this segment, we cannot eliminate any options based on this information alone.\n\nHowever, the presence of a barrier suggests that there might be an attempt to pass through it in subsequent segments.
