There is no indication yet that the dinosaur has had an idea or changed its actions. The scene is static with no movement or change in behavior observed. Given that this is the first segment, there is no historical context to suggest previous ideas or changes in action. Therefore, based on this segment alone, there is no evidence of the dinosaur having an idea that prompts a change in its actions.
