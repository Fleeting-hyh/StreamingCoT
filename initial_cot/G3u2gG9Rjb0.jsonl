The curly-haired man is sitting with his eyes closed, while the other two stand behind him. The text \"Adivina quien te pegó\" suggests a guessing game where the seated man has to identify who tapped him. Since this is the first segment, there's no indication yet of how many times he guessed correctly. The options provided relate to the number of correct guesses, but without further segments showing the outcomes of his guesses, it's impossible to determine the correct answer based on this initial information alone.
