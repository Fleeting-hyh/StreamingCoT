They appear to be engaging in some activity involving the plates. Given the context and the question about the positions of the noodle plates, we need to determine if the plates change positions during the video.\n\nSince this is the first segment provided, there is no prior context to indicate any previous changes in the plate positions. The question asks how many times the positions of the noodle plates change, and the options suggest different frequencies of change.\n\nIn this segment alone, there is no indication that the noodle plates change positions.
