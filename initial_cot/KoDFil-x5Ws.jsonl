The text on the screen suggests a humorous context. There is no indication of clothing changes in this segment. The options mention changes to different colored T-shirts and accessories like sunglasses or a cap. Since the current segment only shows the red T-shirt, we need to consider the options that involve a change from a red T-shirt to another color and back. Option D mentions a change to a blue T-shirt and sunglasses, which could align with the humorous context of making up lyrics.
