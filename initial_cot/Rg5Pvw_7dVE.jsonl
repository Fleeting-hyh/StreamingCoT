The blue fitness equipment is visible in the upper right corner. The kitten appears to be moving forward, and the red mat is the first object it encounters. There is no indication of other objects like a dumbbell, toy mouse, or ball in this segment. Since the dense caption only mentions the red mat and the blue fitness equipment, and the kitten is moving forward, it seems the kitten encounters at least one object (the red mat).
