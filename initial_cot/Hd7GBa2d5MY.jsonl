The text overlay mentions purchasing parking sensors from Temu, suggesting the focus is on the functionality of these sensors. \n\nGiven the context of parking sensors, the final state of the distance indicator line and sound when the vehicle gets very close to an obstacle is typically a warning signal. Parking sensors usually have a color-coded indicator and a sound that changes as the vehicle approaches an obstacle. \n\nOption B states that the final state of the distance indicator line is yellow, and the corresponding sound turns into a continuous beep. This aligns with common parking sensor behavior, where a continuous beep and a warning color (often yellow or red) indicate proximity to an obstacle.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not align with typical sensor behavior. Option A suggests the sound stops, which is unlikely. Option C mentions a flashing green line and a short beep, which is not standard. Option D mentions music, which is also not typical.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the most plausible based on standard parking sensor functionality.\n</think>\n<answer>B</answer>", "answer": "D"}
