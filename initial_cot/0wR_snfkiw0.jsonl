The subtitle Fire Extinguisher Ballsuggests that the ball is intended to extinguish the fire. Given the context, it is likely that the man will throw the ball into the fire, causing it to explode and produce smoke. This would be one instance of an object exploding and producing smoke. There is no indication of any other explosions or smoke production in this segment.
