This suggests that an incorrect tool selection has occurred. The presence of zombies and the green substance might imply a scenario where the woman is in danger, and the life point loss is due to an incorrect action taken to address the situation.\n\nGiven that this is the first segment and there is no prior context indicating previous life point losses, it is reasonable to conclude that this is the first instance of a life point loss due to incorrect tool selection.
