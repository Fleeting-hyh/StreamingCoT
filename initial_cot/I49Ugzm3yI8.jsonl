This action follows the previous step where the hand smoothed the solder on the terminal. Earlier, at [25-35], the hand used a soldering iron to smooth the surface of the metal hole on the positive terminal. This aligns with the sequence of sawing off the metal block, cleaning, wire brushing, soldering, and smoothing observed in earlier segments. The use of water and cloth for cleaning confirms the continuation of Option B, as it involves cleaning and wiping after soldering, not glue or other materials mentioned in other options.
