The dense caption mentions the man standing in a cake shop, which suggests a professional setting for bread preparation. \n\nGiven the context of cutting and packaging, the stages likely involve:\n1. Preparing the bread (as seen in the current frame).\n2. Cutting the bread.\n3. Packaging the bread.\n\nSince the video only shows the initial stage, and no cutting or packaging actions are visible, it's difficult to confirm the exact number of stages. However, based on typical processes in a bakery, there are usually at least three stages: preparation, cutting, and packaging. \n\nOption C (\"There are three stages involved.\") seems plausible based on common bakery practices, but without seeing the entire process, it's uncertain.
