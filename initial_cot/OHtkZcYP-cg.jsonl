This indicates that the action of drinking has not yet begun. The dense caption confirms that the man is displaying the glass artwork, which is unrelated to drinking. Since the video has not shown the man starting to drink, we cannot determine the duration it takes for him to finish drinking from the bottle based on this segment alone.
