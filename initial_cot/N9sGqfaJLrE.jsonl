The goldfish appears to be inspecting or attempting to eat the pea. This is the first instance of the goldfish interacting with the pea. Since there is no prior context or additional segments provided, we can only confirm this single interaction. The question asks how many times the goldfish successfully eats a green pea throughout the video.
