This aligns with the previous segment where the monkey was already under the tree, reaching for the durian. There is no indication of the monkey moving away from the tree or changing its location significantly. \n\nGiven that the monkey has not moved away from the tree in the observed segments, it suggests that the monkey has not changed its location multiple times.
