Option D suggests a turn right to headbutt and a final turn right after running to the left.\n\nSince the dense caption does not provide explicit details about the sheep's movements beyond its initial wary look, we need to infer based on typical sheep behavior when approached by a dog. Sheep often step back and may turn to face a threat, potentially headbutting. \n\nOption A seems plausible as it involves stepping back and turning left, which aligns with a defensive stance.
