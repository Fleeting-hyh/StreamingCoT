The man on the left is over a smaller diamond, while the man on the right is over a larger one. The caption indicates they are both attempting to retrieve diamonds. There is no indication yet of who retrieves the diamond first, as the action is just beginning. The caption does not provide information on the success of their actions, so we cannot determine the outcome from this segment alone. \n\nGiven the options, we need to consider the possibility that neither retrieves the diamond, or that one of them does.
