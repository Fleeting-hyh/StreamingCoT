Three players in black and white striped jerseys are approaching the ball. The text HAALAND WASTING TIMEis displayed, indicating a possible delay tactic. The scene suggests an attempt by the black and white striped players to regain possession. Given the number of players approaching, it seems like there could be multiple attempts to steal the ball. However, the dense caption only mentions the players approaching, not the actual attempts. Based on the visual and caption information, it seems like there is at least one attempt, but the exact number isn't clear. Option C (One time) seems plausible, but without more visual evidence of multiple attempts, it's hard to confirm. Option Z (\no right option) might be considered if the video doesn't clearly show multiple attempts.\n</think>\n<answer>C</answer>", "answer": "D"}
