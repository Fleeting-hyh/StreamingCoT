The man on the left is holding black shovels and pointing them at a white pipe, while the man on the right is holding a hose nozzle to his mouth. In front of them is a musical instrument made of white pipes and orange brackets. This setup suggests that they are using these objects to produce sound. \n\nGiven the question about how many different musical instruments or objects are tapped or played throughout the video, we need to consider the objects being used here. The white pipes and orange brackets form one musical instrument. The black shovels and the hose nozzle are being used by the men, which could be considered as additional objects used to produce sound.\n\nSince this is the first segment and no prior context is available, we can only count the objects seen here. The white pipe instrument is one, the shovels could be another, and the hose nozzle could be a third. This aligns with the option that three different musical instruments or objects are tapped or played.\n\nOptions A and B can be eliminated because they suggest fewer or more objects than observed.
