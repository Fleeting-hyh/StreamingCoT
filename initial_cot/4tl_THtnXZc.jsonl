The character's internal organs, including the lungs and stomach, are visible. The lungs are pink, and the stomach is yellow, indicating a healthy appearance at this moment. There are no visible signs of damage or abnormalities in the lungs and stomach in this frame. \n\nSince this is the only segment provided, there is no indication of any changes occurring to the lungs and stomach by the end of the video.
