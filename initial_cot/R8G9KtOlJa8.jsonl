The presence of the hoe indicates that digging is part of the process.

Option D also involves multiple people repairing and smashing the wall, but the sequence of actions is crucial.\n\nSince the dense caption mentions the man holding a hoe and the red wall with a trophy, it supports the idea that the man in black is involved in digging and eventually obtaining the trophy. The involvement of other people in smashing and repairing the wall is consistent with the actions described in the options.\n\nOption B is less likely because it suggests the man takes the trophy first, which contradicts the initial action of digging.
