Option B involves creating a windbreak and using a lighter, which also isn't depicted. Option C involves inserting and hammering a stake diagonally, which isn't shown yet. Option D involves aligning firewood and inserting a stake vertically, which isn't visible in this segment.\n\nSince the video only shows the person walking towards a tree, it's too early to confirm any specific steps.
