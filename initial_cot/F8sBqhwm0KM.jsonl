{"Timestamp": "1 second", "key_items": ["man actively working under the car,wrench"], "explanation": "<think>\nIn the current segment [0-1], the man is actively working under the car, holding a wrench. This is the first second of the video where he is engaged in repair work. Since there is no prior context or additional segments provided, we can only confirm the activity for this one second. The question asks how many seconds show the man actively working, and based on the current segment alone, we can only confirm one second of active work. Therefore, none of the provided options (A, B, C, D) match the observed activity duration, leading to the conclusion that there is no right option among the given choices.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "D"}
