This is the first vehicle shown towing a vacuum cleaner. There are no other vehicles visible in this segment. The question asks how many different vehicles are shown towing a vacuum cleaner throughout the video. Since this is the first segment and only one vehicle is visible, we can confirm that at least one vehicle is shown. However, without additional segments, we cannot determine the total number of different vehicles.
