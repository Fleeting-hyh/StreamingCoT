These parts appear to be components of a flexible gripper. The video shows the assembly process, but only three distinct parts are visible in this segment. Since the question asks about the total number of different 3D-printed parts involved in the complete assembly, and only three are shown here, it suggests that the assembly might involve these three parts. However, without seeing the entire assembly process, it's uncertain if more parts are involved.

This confirms that the three parts are indeed part of the assembly process. Earlier, at [0-1], the hands were holding three golden 3D-printed parts, which aligns with the current segment showing the assembly of these parts. The scene then resets to the printer platform, where a black cylindrical part is printed and picked up. This suggests that the black cylindrical part is an additional component involved in the assembly. \n\nGiven that the previous reasoning concluded that three parts were involved, the appearance of the black cylindrical part in the current segment indicates that there is at least one more part involved. This means the total number of different 3D-printed parts is more than three. \n\nOption D (Three different 3D-printed parts are involved) can be eliminated because the black cylindrical part is an additional component. Option C (Four different 3D-printed parts are involved) becomes plausible if the black cylindrical part is the fourth part.
