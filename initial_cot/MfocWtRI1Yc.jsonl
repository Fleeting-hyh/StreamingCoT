This action aligns with the beginning of the sequence described in Option C. The background shows a brick-paved ground and a part of a white shoe, indicating the setting is consistent throughout the video. There is no indication of the tire being held steady by another hand or any other actions that would suggest a different sequence. The focus is on the interaction between the wrenches and the tire's metal part, which supports the initial steps of Option C.
