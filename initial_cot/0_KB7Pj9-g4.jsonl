The woman's reaction is not clearly described as either positive or negative, but she is shown pointing at the cake, which might indicate curiosity or confusion rather than a clear response to the taste. Given the previous reasoning that the cakes might not be real, it's possible that the woman's reaction is not about the taste but rather the appearance or realization that the cakes are not real.
