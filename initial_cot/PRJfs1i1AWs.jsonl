The dense caption mentions the girl standing and looking up, which suggests she is not actively engaging with the jars in this specific moment.\n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context or interactions mentioned, we cannot confirm any interactions with the jars yet. The question asks how many times she interacts with the jars, but based on this segment alone, there is no evidence of interaction.
