Her hair is not yet standing on end, indicating that the static electricity effect has not started. This is the initial moment of interaction with the exhibit. \n\nSince there is no prior context or previous segments to refer to, we cannot determine the duration of the static electricity effect on her hair yet. The dense caption confirms the setting and the girl's action but does not provide information about the static effect's duration.\n\nGiven the options, we need to observe further segments to determine how long her hair remains standing on end due to static electricity.
