The ground is covered with dry leaves and dirt, and there are buildings with red roofs in the background. The substance appears to be dropping from the elephant's body, suggesting defecation rather than urination or spraying water. The color and consistency of the substance align more closely with feces than with urine or water. The action is completed as the camera pans down, showing the elephant's back and the substance falling to the ground. This eliminates options B and D, as they involve urine or water, respectively.
