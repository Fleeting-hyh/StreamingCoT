There is no indication of her waving hello in this segment. Since there is no prior context or previous segments to refer to, we cannot determine if she has waved hello before or after this segment. Therefore, based on the information available in this segment alone, we cannot confirm any waving action.\n\nGiven the options, we need to consider the possibility that the video might not show her waving at all in the provided segment.
