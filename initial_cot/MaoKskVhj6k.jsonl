The machine appears to be a type of agricultural equipment, possibly a tiller or a similar device. The dense caption mentions that the machine is red and black, and the man is facing it. There is no indication yet of the machine spinning rapidly or stopping, so we cannot determine the duration it runs from this segment alone. \n\nSince there is no prior context or additional frames provided, we cannot confirm how long the machine runs after it starts spinning rapidly. The options given are based on a specific duration, but without seeing the machine in operation or stopping, we cannot accurately choose between them.
