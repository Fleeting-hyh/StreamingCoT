He is crouching, and there is green tape on the column and floor. The video shows a tic-tac-toe grid with a red square and a white cross in the bottom left corner. The man appears to be interacting with the grid, possibly changing squares. \n\nSince this is the first segment, there is no prior context to compare with. The question asks how many times the man successfully changes a square to a red background with a white cross throughout the video.
