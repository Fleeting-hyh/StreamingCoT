{"Timestamp": "1 second", "key_items": [], "explanation": "<think>\nAt [0-1], the video shows a metal machine dispensing dough onto a gridded metal tray. This is the initial step in the donut-making process.

The dense caption confirms the dough is being dispensed, aligning with the visual content.
