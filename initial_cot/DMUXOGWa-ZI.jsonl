Option B involves wrapping grapes in a candy wrapper, which is not indicated. Option C mentions mixing grapes with chocolate chips, and Option D involves dipping grapes in honey, neither of which are suggested by the current scene.\n\nSince the dense caption does not provide specific details about grapes or the actions described in the options, and the scene focuses on the women interacting with bags, Option A seems the most plausible as it involves a bag, which is present in the scene.
