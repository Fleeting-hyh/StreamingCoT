There is no indication of him rolling his eyes in this segment. The dense caption mentions a round magnifier over each eye, which might affect eye movements, but it doesn't specify any eye rolling. Since this is the first segment and there's no prior context, I can't confirm any previous eye rolling. The options suggest counting instances, but without evidence of eye rolling in this segment, I can't eliminate any options yet.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "B"}
