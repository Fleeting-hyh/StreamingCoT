{"Timestamp": "1 second", "key_items": ["black container"], "explanation": "<think>\nAt  [0-1], the boy dressed as Mario is standing in front of a white door with a black container on a marble table. The container is stationary in this frame. There is no indication of shaking in this segment. Since this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we cannot determine any shaking events yet. The question asks about the number of times the black container shook throughout the video, but we only have information for the first second.
