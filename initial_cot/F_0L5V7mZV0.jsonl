There is no indication that the lever has been pulled yet. The scene is static, and the focus is on the setup with the person lying on the ground and the monitor in the purple top. Since this is the beginning of the video and no prior context is available, we cannot determine any previous actions involving the lever. The question asks how many times the brown lever was pulled throughout the video, but based on this segment alone, we have no evidence of any pulls.
