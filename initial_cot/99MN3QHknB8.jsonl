The luminous bear's jumping and emergence from the water sequence is not visible in this segment. Since the question asks about the duration of the bear's sequence, and this segment does not show it, I need to consider the options based on the information provided. The dense caption does not mention the bear or any water sequence, so I cannot confirm the duration from this segment alone.
