This is the first direct interaction with the fish observed in the video. The caption and visual indicate that the man is actively engaged in moving the fish, which confirms the interaction. There is no prior context or additional interactions mentioned in this segment, so the interaction count remains at one. The man in the gray shirt is not involved in the interaction with the fish.
