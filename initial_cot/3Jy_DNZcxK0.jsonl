This is the first instance of pouring liquid from one container to another. The dense caption confirms the presence of a bottle and a glass on the table, aligning with the action observed. Since this is the first segment and no prior actions are mentioned, we can only confirm this single instance of pouring. The question asks for the total number of times the man pours liquid, and based on this segment alone, we can only account for one instance. However, the options provided suggest multiple instances, so we need to consider the possibility of more actions in subsequent segments.
