This is the first caption observed in the video. Since there is no prior context or additional captions mentioned in this segment, we can only confirm the presence of one type of caption so far. The question asks about the total number of different types of captions representing different years throughout the video. Given that only one caption is visible in this segment, we cannot yet determine the total number. However, we can eliminate options that suggest fewer than one type of caption, such as Option D, which mentions three types, as it is not supported by the current evidence. Further segments are needed to confirm the total number of different captions.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "C"}
