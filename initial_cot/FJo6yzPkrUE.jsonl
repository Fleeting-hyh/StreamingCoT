The caption @Shortest Blockbustersappears, but it doesn't provide information about animals. Since no animals are observed in this segment, it suggests that the count of animals appearing in the video is still zero. This eliminates options A, B, and C, as they all suggest multiple animals. Option D suggests only one animal, but since none are seen, it also doesn't fit.
