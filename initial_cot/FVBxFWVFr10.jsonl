This is the first frame of the video, and there is no indication of a red Teletubby or any emotional state change yet. The question asks about the duration of the red Teletubby's depressed state before it appears happy. Since the current segment only shows the purple Teletubby, there is no information about the red Teletubby's emotional state or duration of depression.

Earlier, at [0-1], the red Teletubby was already showing signs of distress with its hands up and mouth open. This suggests the red Teletubby has been in a depressed state for at least two seconds.
