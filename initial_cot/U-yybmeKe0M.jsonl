The elderly woman stands beside him, observing. The man's action of smashing the concrete ditch is captured in this segment. Given the description and the limited timeframe of one second, it's reasonable to infer that he performs the action once during this frame.\n\nConsidering the question asks how many times the man smashes the concrete ditch during the video, and based on the current segment, he performs the action once. There is no indication of multiple actions within this segment, so we can infer the action occurs once.\n\nOption D (\"The man smashes the concrete ditch only once during the video.\") aligns with this observation.\n</think>\n<answer>D</answer>", "answer": "B"}
