There is no indication of him changing the direction he is looking in this segment. The background shows a Christmas tree and a white cabinet, but these details do not affect the boy's gaze direction. Since this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we cannot determine any previous changes in his gaze direction. Therefore, based on the information available, the boy has not changed the direction he is looking yet.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "D"}
