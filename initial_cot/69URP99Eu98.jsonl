This setup is characteristic of hydro dipping, a process where a paint film floats on water and is transferred onto an object. The presence of the colorful paint layer on the liquid surface and the man's action of holding the wheel hub above it suggest he is about to submerge it to apply the paint pattern.

This eliminates options A (electroplating), C (powder coating), and D (airbrushing), which do not involve submerging an object into a liquid with a floating paint film. The text HYDRODIPTULSAfurther supports the hydro dipping process.\n\nEarlier, at [10-20], the man continued to submerge most of the hub into the water, allowing the colorful paint to adhere to its surface.
