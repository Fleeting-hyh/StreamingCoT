The dense caption mentions that he is sitting with his right arm bent on the table, indicating he is engaged in eating. The question asks how long he spends chewing before the camera pans to the man holding the white plate. Since this is the first segment and there is no indication of the camera panning yet, we need to consider the duration of this action. The options provided are specific time frames, and without further context or additional segments, we can't determine the exact time spent chewing.
