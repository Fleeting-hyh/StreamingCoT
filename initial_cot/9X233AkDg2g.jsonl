At [10-17], he attempted to pull a retractable handle but it didn't budge, and he continued digging with his hands. At [17-24], he used a metal shovel to dig and then continued with his hands. At [01-10], he used a metal detector and swept the ground, revealing a black edge.\n\nOption D mentions using a metal shovel, which is shown in the current segment. It also includes the sequence of using a metal detector, revealing a black edge, digging with hands, pulling a retractable handle, continuing to dig, and successfully retrieving the trolley.
