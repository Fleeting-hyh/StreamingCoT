This is the first time we see him open his mouth to speak in the video. There are no other instances of him speaking in this segment. Since this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we can only confirm one instance of him speaking so far. The options suggest multiple instances, but based on the current information, we can only confirm one instance. Therefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D can be confirmed yet, as they all suggest more than one instance.
