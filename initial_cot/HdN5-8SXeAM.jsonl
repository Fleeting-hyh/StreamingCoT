This is the first instance of water spillage due to improper use of the funnel.\n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we can only confirm one instance of spillage so far.

{"Timestamp": "37 second", "key_items": ["man pouring water without the funnel,water spillage"], "explanation": "<think>\nAt [29-37], the man successfully pours water into the bottle using the funnel, but earlier in the video, there were instances of incorrect pouring. At [01-02], the man poured water without the funnel, causing spillage. At [20-24], the funnel fell off, leading to more spillage. These two instances of incorrect pouring align with the question's focus on attempts without using the funnel correctly. The man's successful attempt in the current segment does not count as an incorrect attempt. Therefore, the total number of incorrect attempts remains two.\n\nOption D (\"Two times\") is consistent with these observations.\n</think>\n<answer>D</answer>", "answer": "C"}
