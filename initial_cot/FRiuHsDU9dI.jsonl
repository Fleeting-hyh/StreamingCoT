In the upper right corner, there is a smaller window showing another man holding a woman near a tree. This suggests that there are at least two women being held in different settings. The question asks how many women appear to be stuck in a tree throughout the video. The smaller window shows one woman near a tree, but it doesn't clearly indicate she is stuck.
