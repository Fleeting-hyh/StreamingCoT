The caption \"ROUND 1\" suggests this is the beginning of a challenge. The cat is positioned in front of the obstacles, indicating it is about to start jumping. Since this is the first segment, there is no prior evidence of the cat jumping over any obstacles yet. Therefore, the count of successful jumps is zero at this point.
