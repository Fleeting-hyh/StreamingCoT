        "explanation": "[0-0] A man wearing a black short-sleeved shirt, black shorts, and black shoes is standing on a patch of mud, facing the camera with his legs apart. His right foot is in a pit, and his hands are gripping a steel cable. The other end of the cable is attached to a cylindrical weight placed at one end of a curved slide rail. The mud is surrounded by a vast expanse of grassland, with trees and rolling mountains in the distance. The sun is above the horizon, and there are some grayish-white clouds in the sky."

The man then swings the cable in the opposite direction. Due to inertia, the weight rapidly spins around the man one and a half times, causing the man to turn around."
