She points a finger at the baby as if reprimanding him for his unhealthy eating habits. Her eyebrows are furrowed, her mouth is open in anger, and it's clear that she's not happy with the situation. As the grandma's emotions reach their peak, a translucent blue-green figure emerges from within her and slowly rises. This new figure shares the same facial features as the grandma, but his expression is completely different: a wide grin spreads across his face, and his eyes gleam with mischief. The baby continues gnawing on the chicken leg, watching everything unfold before him with an indifferent expression, seemingly unfazed by the unfolding drama. The scene then cuts back to the beginning of the animation, with the baby sitting on the floor happily gnawing on his chicken leg, his face and hands still covered in sauce."
