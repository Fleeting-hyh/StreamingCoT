It then cuts back to Tom, who still has his eyes wide open, his expression worried. He is now holding a device that emits a blue-green light. The scene then shifts to a busy city street, where an orange and white cat wearing a hat is kidnapping a white female cat, Angela, who is trapped in a metal cage. The kidnapper is riding a motorcycle that breathes fire. The scene then cuts to Angela in the cage, her blue eyes wide open and mouth open, looking terrified. Then it cuts back to Tom, who is running down a city street looking worried. Then it cuts to Tom, who is now in a red and yellow superhero costume, flying between buildings to rescue Angela.
