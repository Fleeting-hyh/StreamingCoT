        "explanation": "[0-0] The video is presented in a picture-in-picture format. The main screen shows a man with headphones sitting behind a drum set against a black background, with a purple cloth laid underneath the drumhead. He is wearing a burgundy T-shirt and dark pants, holding two ring-shaped drumsticks in both hands. The drumstick in his right hand has colorful ribbons hanging from the end. He is looking at the lower right corner and smiling. A small screen to the right of the man's head shows a metal container placed in a bowl of glue-like substance, which is placed on a silver-gray container."

As the stirring speed increases in the small screen, the man's rubbing speed also accelerates. Subsequently, the small screen shows the glue-like substance being taken out of the bowl and thrown onto a grayish-white background, and the man follows by flipping his right drumstick and swinging it downwards. In the small screen, a gloved hand picks up a silver metal lid and presses it down on the glue-like substance, flattening it and thinning it out, which the man watches in amazement. Then the hand takes a doll-shaped mold and presses it onto the glue-like substance, followed by the hand taking the silver metal lid and placing it on top of the glue-like substance, at which point the man strikes the drumstick once. The hand removes the doll-shaped mold, revealing the doll model left on the glue-like substance. Subsequently, a five-pointed star and an umbrella model are pressed onto this glue-like substance. During this process, the man watches curiously, his two hands moving along with the actions displayed on the small screen."
