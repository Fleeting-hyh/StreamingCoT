This is the initial step in the cake decoration process. The chef's uniform and the setting suggest a professional kitchen environment. The cake is placed on a wire rack, indicating it might be cooling or ready for decoration. \n\nGiven the options, the first step involves applying pink frosting. However, in this segment, the cake is still plain white, so no frosting has been applied yet. This suggests that the video might show the initial stages before any decoration begins. \n\nOption C mentions pouring pink frosting onto the cake, which aligns with the next expected step after the cake is prepared. The other options involve different initial steps or tools not visible in this segment. \n\nSince the cake is plain and no decoration has started, the process described in Option C seems plausible as it starts with applying frosting, which is a common first step in cake decoration.\n</think>\n<answer>C</answer>", "answer": "C"}
