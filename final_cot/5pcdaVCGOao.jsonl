The scene is set in a colorful playground with a clear blue sky and tires visible beside them. The baby is sitting in the swing, smiling happily. Since the video only shows the initial moment when the woman is about to let go of the swing, it's not possible to determine how long the baby continues to spin based on this single frame.
