Since the video shows the dough and chocolate in a solid state, it suggests that the melting process has not yet begun. The options provided include a specific time frame of 5 seconds, which could be plausible if the melting process starts shortly after this frame. However, without seeing the actual melting process, it's challenging to confirm the exact duration.
