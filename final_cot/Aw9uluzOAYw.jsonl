Each block has eyes and teeth, displaying a grimace. The blocks are purple, pink, blue, and green. The question asks how many blocks showed human-like facial expressions during the whole video. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context, I can only analyze the current frame. The frame clearly shows multiple blocks with human-like facial expressions. Specifically, there are four blocks visible with these features. \n\nGiven the options, Option B (\"Four blocks\") matches the observation from the current segment. There is no indication of any other blocks or changes in the number of blocks with facial expressions in this segment.\n</think>\n<answer>B</answer>", "answer": "A"}
