Since this is the first segment and no other locations have been mentioned or shown, we can only confirm one location so far. \n\nGiven the options, we need to consider the possibility of future segments showing more locations.

Therefore, the answer must be based on the information available up to this point.\n\nOption A (Three) and Option B (Five) are not supported by the current evidence. Option C (Two) is also not supported as only one location has been shown. Option D (Four) is similarly unsupported. Option Z (\no right option) could be considered if no other locations are shown in future segments, but based on the current segment alone, we cannot confirm this.\n\nSince the question asks for the number of locations visited throughout the video and we only have information about one location so far, we cannot definitively choose any option without more context.
