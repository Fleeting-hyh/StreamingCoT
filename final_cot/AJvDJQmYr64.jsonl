This is the first object he interacts with that we have observed. The background details, such as the purple cabinet and wall with photos, do not count as objects he interacts with. Since this is the first segment and no prior interactions with objects are mentioned, we can only confirm the lighter as one object so far. \n\nBased on the limited information available in this segment, we cannot yet determine the total number of objects the man will interact with throughout the video.

The background details like the purple cabinet and wall with photos are not objects he interacts with.
