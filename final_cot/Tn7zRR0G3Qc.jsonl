A man in a black T-shirt and grey pants is standing on the side of the road, watching the trucks. The scene is static, with no indication of movement or perspective change within this segment.\n\nSince there is no prior context or previous segments to compare with, we cannot determine any perspective changes from earlier parts of the video. The question asks how many times the perspective changes during the video to follow the movement and interactions of the two trucks. Given that this segment shows a static scene with no movement or change in perspective, we cannot confirm any changes based on this segment alone.\n\nHowever, the options provided suggest that the perspective changes multiple times throughout the video. Without additional segments or context, we cannot eliminate any options based on this single segment.
