A woman in a yellow bathing suit top and black bottoms is prominently visible. Behind her, there are two other women, one in blue bottoms and another in black bottoms. Additionally, other people are present on the beach, some in swimwear and some in clothes. \n\nSince this is the first segment, there is no prior context to compare with. The question asks for the total number of distinct women wearing bathing suits in the entire video.

However, without additional segments to confirm if more women in bathing suits appear later, we cannot definitively eliminate other options.
