The person on the left is wearing zebra-print pants, and the person on the right is wearing a plaid shirt. Both are riding motorcycles with very high handlebars. This is the first segment, so there are no prior segments to compare with. The question asks for the total number of unique rider appearances throughout the video. Since there are two distinct riders in this segment, and no prior context to suggest additional riders, the initial count is two. There are no contradictions or additional details to suggest more riders in this segment.
