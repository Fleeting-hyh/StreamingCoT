The text \"How you see Mocha\" is displayed at the top. This suggests that the puppy is being introduced or showcased in a specific way. Since this is the first segment and no other activities involving the puppy have been shown, it's clear that only one activity is depicted so far. The question asks about the number of separate activities involving the puppy shown in the video. Given that only one activity is visible in this segment, options A, B, D, and Z can be eliminated as they suggest more activities than what has been observed.
