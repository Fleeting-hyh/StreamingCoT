Since there is no prior context or additional Ferraris mentioned in previous segments, we can only confirm the presence of one Ferrari so far. \n\nGiven the options, we need to determine how many unique Ferraris appear in the entire video. Since only one Ferrari has been observed in this segment, and there is no information about additional Ferraris in the provided context, we cannot confirm any of the options that suggest multiple Ferraris (A, B, C, D).
