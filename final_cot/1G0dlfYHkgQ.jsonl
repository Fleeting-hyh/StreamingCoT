The <start>fist in Frame2</start><bbox>[0.503, 0.808, 0.44, 0.136]</bbox> pressing down firmly on the <start>egg in Frame2</start><bbox>[0.503, 0.808, 0.44, 0.136]</bbox> caused the cartoon face to become distorted, as seen at [2-5]. This suggests the <start>egg in Frame2</start><bbox>[0.503, 0.808, 0.44, 0.136]</bbox> was being crushed for a few seconds before it was completely crushed. The sequence of events and visual evidence indicate the <start>egg in Frame2</start><bbox>[0.503, 0.808, 0.44, 0.136]</bbox> remains in a state of being crushed for a short period, likely around 3 seconds, as the <start>fist in Frame2</start><bbox>[0.503, 0.808, 0.44, 0.136]</bbox> presses down and the <start>egg in Frame2</start><bbox>[0.503, 0.808, 0.44, 0.136]</bbox> is crushed and split. This aligns with Option D.\n</think>\n<answer>D</answer>", "answer": "D"}
