The question asks about the total number of different environments throughout the video, but with only one environment observed, we cannot yet determine the total number. However, based on the options given, we can eliminate options that suggest more environments than observed.\n\nOption A suggests three environments, Option B suggests two, Option C suggests five, and Option D suggests four. Since we have only observed one environment, options A, C, and D are not supported by the current evidence. Option B suggests two environments, which could be possible if another environment is introduced later, but with the current information, we cannot confirm this.
