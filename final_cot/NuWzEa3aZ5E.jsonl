The anchor is partially buried in the sand. This is the first anchor shown in the video. The dense caption mentions \"LAD BIBLE EXTRA\" in the upper right corner, but this does not affect the count of anchors. Since this is the first segment and no other anchors have been shown or mentioned, we can only confirm the presence of one anchor so far. The question asks how many different anchors are shown and dragged across the sand throughout the video. Given that only one anchor has been observed in this segment, we cannot yet determine the total number of anchors. However, we can eliminate options that suggest a higher number of anchors based on the current information.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "B"}
