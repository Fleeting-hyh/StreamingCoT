There are two blue water bottles on the table, one upright and one lying down. The ranks above them are visible, but no bottle flipping action has occurred yet. There's no indication of additional heads appearing at this point.\n\nGiven that the question involves the appearance of additional heads and the number by the end of the video, I need to observe further segments for bottle flipping actions and subsequent changes in the number of heads.
