There is no direct interaction shown yet, but the man's gesture implies an attempt to collaborate or engage. \n\nSince this is the first segment and no prior interactions are mentioned, we can only count this one potential engagement. The question asks for collaborative engagements throughout the video, and based on this segment alone, we have one instance.
