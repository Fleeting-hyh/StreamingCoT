The current segment only shows the initial reaction, so we need to consider the typical duration of such reactions in animations. Usually, such reactions are brief, lasting a few seconds before the character takes action.\n\nOption C suggests approximately 5 seconds, which is a reasonable duration for a fear or surprise reaction before the character decides to run away.
