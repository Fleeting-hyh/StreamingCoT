The dense caption confirms that he is on the rooftop with a tool in hand. This is the first instance of spreading material observed in the video. Since there is no prior context or additional segments provided, we can only confirm this single action. The question asks how many times he spreads the material, and based on the current segment, we only have evidence of one instance. However, the options provided suggest multiple instances, so without further segments, we cannot confirm any of the specific numbers given in the options. Therefore, the best choice is to indicate that there is no right option based on the current information.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "A"}
