A woman in a red coat is holding the handle of the shovel, preparing to push them down. The scene suggests that the children are about to slide down the steps into the snow. Since this is the first segment and there is no prior context indicating previous slides, it is likely that this is the first time the shovel with the children slides down the steps. The dense caption confirms that they are facing a pile of snow, indicating the action is about to happen.
