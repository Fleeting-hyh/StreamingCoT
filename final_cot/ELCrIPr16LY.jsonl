{"Timestamp": "2 second", "key_items": [], "explanation": "<think>\nAt [1-4], the yacht executes a drift to stop at the pier of the small island. The game screen displays \"Perfect score! 1000,\" indicating the yacht has reached the pier and is stationary.

Earlier, at [0-1], the yacht was seen sailing towards the island, and there was no indication of it being stationary. The yacht's movement towards the pier and the subsequent display of a perfect score suggest it stops only once at the pier. This eliminates options A and B, which suggest multiple stops.
