The woman in the red top suddenly appears and startles her. The woman in white reacts with surprise, but the video only shows this moment briefly. Given the short duration of the video segment, the state of surprise likely lasts for a very short time. \n\nConsidering the options, the state of surprise lasting for 3 seconds (Option A) seems plausible because the video captures a quick reaction. Options B and C suggest longer durations, which are not supported by the brief video segment. Option D suggests 5 seconds, which is also longer than what is shown. Therefore, Option A is the most likely duration based on the visible reaction time.\n</think>\n<answer>A</answer>", "answer": "A"}
