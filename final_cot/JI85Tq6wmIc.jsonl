Since the video shows only the initial spin and no further spins are visible in this segment, I cannot determine the number of times the ball points to the right yet. The options provided suggest multiple spins and results, but this segment does not show the outcome of multiple spins. Therefore, I need to rely on the information provided in the video, which does not show the ball pointing to the right side more than once in this frame.
