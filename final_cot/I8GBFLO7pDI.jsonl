There are no head movements observed during this timeframe.

The options provided are based on the total number of head movements from start to finish, but with only one second observed so far, no head movements have been made.\n\nGiven that no head movements are observed in this segment, and considering that the options require counting movements across the entire video, we cannot determine the correct option yet.
