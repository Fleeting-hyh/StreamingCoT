He appears to be about to eat the <start>Oreo cookie in Frame27</start><bbox>[0.483, 0.506, 0.117, 0.058]</bbox>. Since this is the first segment, there is no prior context to compare with. The question asks how many times the <start>Oreo cookie in Frame27</start><bbox>[0.483, 0.506, 0.117, 0.058]</bbox> returns to its original state. Given that the cookie is still intact in this frame, it has not yet been altered or returned to any state. Therefore, the cookie has not returned to its original state at all in this segment.
