There are no visible red pixelated hearts above any characters in this segment. Since this is the first segment and no prior context is available, we cannot determine the number of characters with red hearts yet.

This segment introduces two characters with hearts. The question asks how many different characters have red hearts by the end of the video. Since only two characters are shown with hearts in this segment, and no prior segments indicate additional characters with hearts, the options suggesting more than two characters (A, B, C) are not supported. Option D suggests three characters, but only two are visible here.
