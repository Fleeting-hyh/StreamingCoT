One of the ladies is in the process of jumping off the <start>seesaw in Frame10</start><bbox>[0.48, 0.715, 0.56, 0.087]</bbox>, which suggests that the <start>seesaw in Frame10</start><bbox>[0.48, 0.715, 0.56, 0.087]</bbox> is being used. Given the setup, it is likely that the <start>seesaw in Frame10</start><bbox>[0.48, 0.715, 0.56, 0.087]</bbox> will launch someone into the air. Since the video only shows one instance of a person jumping off the <start>seesaw in Frame10</start><bbox>[0.48, 0.715, 0.56, 0.087]</bbox>, it indicates that the <start>seesaw in Frame10</start><bbox>[0.48, 0.715, 0.56, 0.087]</bbox> is used once to launch someone into the air.
