Since the video does not show the <start>seal in Frame31</start><bbox>[0.83, 0.907, 0.136, 0.078]</bbox> being flipped or reveal its back, I cannot confirm details about its backside. The dense caption only mentions the <start>seal in Frame31</start><bbox>[0.83, 0.907, 0.136, 0.078]</bbox> being placed on paper, not its back or any specific features.

This detail is consistent with the dense caption, confirming the functionality of the seal. Earlier, the seal was shown being used to create math problems on paper, suggesting its purpose is related to mathematical calculations. The video clearly shows the back of the seal with numbers and symbols, which aligns with Option B.
