The question asks about the number of different colored balloons that transform into pufferfish by the end of the video.

However, the presence of a single glove suggests that more might be introduced in subsequent segments.\n\nOptions A, B, C, and D all suggest different numbers of balloons, but without further information, it is impossible to confirm any of these options.
