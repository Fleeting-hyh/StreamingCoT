The background shows a yard with palm trees and houses, but this doesn't directly relate to the food icons. \n\nGiven the options, we need to determine how each food type is marked as finished. Option A suggests icons are crossed out, while Option B suggests a green check mark. Since the dense caption doesn't mention any marks yet, we can't confirm this yet. Option C introduces ice cream, which isn't shown, and Option D mentions salad, which isn't part of the icons. \n\nWithout seeing the icons being marked, we can't confirm the exact method, but the icons suggest five types of food.
