Option B (He is amazed and takes a picture to capture the moment.) is less likely unless the situation is humorous or extraordinary.

Option D (He expresses discomfort but stays, trying to avoid eye contact.) might occur if the man is uncomfortable but not overtly startled.\n\nGiven the playful context suggested by the woman's smile and the glue stick, Option A seems the most likely reaction if the man is genuinely surprised by the woman's appearance.\n</think>\n<answer>A</answer>", "answer": "A"}
