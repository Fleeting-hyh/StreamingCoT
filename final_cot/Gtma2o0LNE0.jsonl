Therefore, Option A, which suggests three interactions, aligns with the current evidence.\n\nOptions B, C, and D suggest different counts, but we have evidence for three interactions so far. Option Z suggests no right option, but Option A is supported by the current evidence.\n</think>\n<answer>A</answer>", "answer": "A"}
