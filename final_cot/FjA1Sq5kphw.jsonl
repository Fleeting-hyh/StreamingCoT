The driver must notice the cake and take action. Given the wet conditions, the driver likely needs to slow down or stop to avoid the cake. \n\nSince the video shows the go-kart approaching the cake, the driver's next logical action would be to stop or slow down. This aligns with options B and C, which involve stopping the go-kart.
