The background includes potted plants and a picture on a pink-blue triangular-patterned wall.

The options provided involve different methods of teeth whitening, such as using a mixture with toothpaste and baking soda, a whitening gel with a mouthguard, a lemon and sugar solution, or <start>whitening strip in Frame17</start><bbox>[0.678, 0.556, 0.361, 0.246]</bbox>s.\n\nSince the current segment only shows them taking a selfie, it doesn't provide direct evidence of the teeth whitening process.
