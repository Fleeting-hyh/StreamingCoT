The subtitle \"I LOST BECAUSE OF SQUIDWARD\" is displayed, indicating a character named Squidward is involved. This suggests that at least three characters are present initially. The question asks how many different characters join the game before \"You lose!\" appears. Since the dense caption mentions SpongeBob and two Patricks, and the subtitle hints at Squidward, it implies that Squidward is another character involved. This brings the total to at least four characters. However, without seeing the entire sequence, it's unclear if more characters join.
