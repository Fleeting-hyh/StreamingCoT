However, in this specific segment, the hearts are not yet whole. The question asks how many times a heart becomes whole in the video. Given that this is the first segment and the hearts are not yet whole, we need to consider the possibility of future segments where the hearts might come together.\n\nBased on the current segment alone, the hearts are not whole, so we cannot confirm any of the options yet.
