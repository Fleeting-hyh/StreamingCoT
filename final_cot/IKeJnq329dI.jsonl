This is the first time he displays the package in the video. The dense caption confirms that he is holding the package, and the text \"Normal People\" is displayed above him. Since this is the first segment, there are no prior instances to compare with. The question asks how many times he holds or displays the package throughout the video, and based on this segment alone, it is one time. However, since the video is not complete, we cannot determine the total number of times yet. The options provided include multiple instances, so we need to consider the possibility of more occurrences in subsequent segments.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "A"}
