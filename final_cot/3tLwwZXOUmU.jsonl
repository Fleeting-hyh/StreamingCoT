Option B mentions a blue feather and white paste, which are not observed. Option C mentions a green feather and black paint, which are also not observed.

However, since the options do not perfectly align with the observed objects, the best choice is Z.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "D"}
