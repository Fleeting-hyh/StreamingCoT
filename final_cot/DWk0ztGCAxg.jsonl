This confirms that he was lying down during the previous attempts to drink the liquid. Earlier, at [12-20], it was revealed that he was lying on the cushion, which caused the liquid to flow away due to gravity. This consistent issue across different containers (bottle and mug) suggests that his position on the cushion is the primary cause of the problem. The liquid flows out because he is not in an upright position, making it impossible for him to drink it properly. This aligns with the reasoning from previous segments, where the position on the cushion was identified as the cause.
