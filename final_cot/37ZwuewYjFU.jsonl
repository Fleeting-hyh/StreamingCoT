The question asks how many different colors of motorcycles appear in the video. \n\nGiven that only one color (pink) has been observed so far, we can eliminate options that suggest more than one color. Options A, B, and D suggest multiple colors, which are not supported by the current evidence. Option C suggests two colors, but we have only seen one.
