The question asks about successful dodges during both the stick and knife phases, but we only see the stick phase here. There is no indication of a knife or any dodges occurring in this segment. Therefore, we cannot confirm any successful dodges yet. The options suggest a range of possible successful dodges, but without further information on the knife phase or additional segments showing the actions, we cannot determine the exact number.
