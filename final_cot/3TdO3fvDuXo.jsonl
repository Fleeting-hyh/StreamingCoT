The options describe different reactions: laughing, smiling, shrugging, or frowning. Since the video does not show the girl's reaction directly, we rely on the context and the nature of the problem. The correct mathematical answer to 2 + 2 x 2is 6, following the order of operations (multiplication before addition). An answer of 8suggests a misunderstanding of the order of operations.\n\nOption D suggests a serious reaction, which aligns with the incorrect answer.
