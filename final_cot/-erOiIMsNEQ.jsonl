The bottle is initially placed on the table, and the man's hand is visible, indicating he might spin the bottle. The presence of multiple car keys around the bottle implies that the spinning action will determine which car he drives. \n\nSince the video segment is only one second long, it's not possible to see the bottle spinning or the outcome of the spin.
