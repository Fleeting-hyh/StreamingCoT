Based on this observation, only one object has been dipped so far. The question asks for the total number of distinct objects dipped or submerged throughout the entire video, but with only one instance observed in this segment, we can't yet determine the total without further information from subsequent segments.

{"Timestamp": "4 second", "key_items": ["Balloon,Tool"], "explanation": "<think>\nAt [3-10], the video shows a hand dipping a balloon into a bowl of melted chocolate sauce. This is consistent with the previous segment where a similar action was observed. The dense caption confirms that the balloon is being dipped into the chocolate sauce. Additionally, the balloon is later covered in candies and used to create a hollow chocolate bowl, which is filled with ice cream. This indicates that the balloon itself is a distinct object being dipped. Earlier, a tool was dipped into the chocolate sauce. Given that two distinct objects (the tool and the balloon) are involved in dipping or submerging actions, this confirms the count. The question asks for the total number of distinct objects dipped or submerged, and the evidence supports that two distinct objects are involved.
