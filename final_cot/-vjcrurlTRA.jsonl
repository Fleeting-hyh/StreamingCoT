The dense caption describes their actions but does not mention any <start>heart gesture in Frame22</start><bbox>[0.648, 0.569, 0.297, 0.232]</bbox>s.

The question asks how many times a <start>heart gesture in Frame22</start><bbox>[0.648, 0.569, 0.297, 0.232]</bbox> appears in the video, and based on the current segment, there is no indication of any <start>heart gesture in Frame22</start><bbox>[0.648, 0.569, 0.297, 0.232]</bbox>s. Therefore, the options that suggest <start>heart gesture in Frame22</start><bbox>[0.648, 0.569, 0.297, 0.232]</bbox>s occurring multiple times (A, C, D) can be eliminated.
