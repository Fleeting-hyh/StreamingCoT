In the background, a person in a Spider-Man costume is partially visible. This segment shows two different costumes: a police uniform and a Spider-Man costume. There is no indication of additional people or costumes in this segment.\n\nSince this is the first segment, no prior context or reasoning can be applied. The question asks how many people appear in different costumes throughout the video. Based on this segment alone, we have identified two costumes: the police uniform and the Spider-Man costume.\n\nOption A suggests five people, Option B suggests six people, Option C suggests four people, and Option D suggests three people. Since only two different costumes are visible in this segment, none of the options A, B, C, or D can be confirmed yet.
