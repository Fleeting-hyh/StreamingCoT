The dense caption mentions that one side of the earth pile has been dug into steps, but it doesn't specify the exact number. Observing the steps visually, there appear to be four distinct levels created by the excavator. This aligns with the description of the earth being dug into steps, suggesting that the excavator has created multiple steps.
