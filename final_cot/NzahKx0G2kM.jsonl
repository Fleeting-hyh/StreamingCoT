This suggests the beginning of a process involving iodine, likely related to the stain on the white shirt mentioned in the question. \n\nSince there is no prior context or additional frames provided, I can't observe the interaction between sodium thiosulfate and the iodine stain directly. However, based on the options and the typical chemical reaction between sodium thiosulfate and iodine, sodium thiosulfate is known to reduce iodine, causing it to fade. This aligns with Option B, where the stain gradually fades until only a faint trace remains.\n\nOptions A, C, and D describe outcomes that do not match the expected chemical behavior of sodium thiosulfate with iodine.
