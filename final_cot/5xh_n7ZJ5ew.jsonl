The dense caption mentions their names above them, but there is no indication of any phone calls being answered in this segment. Since the question asks how many times they answer mobile phone calls, and there is no visible action of answering a call in this segment, we can infer that no calls have been answered yet. Therefore, the options that suggest multiple calls (A, C, D) are not supported by the current segment. Option B (\"Once\") is also not supported as there is no evidence of a call being answered. Option Z (\"no right option\") seems plausible as there is no indication of any calls being answered in this segment.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "A"}
