This is the first segment, so there's no prior context to compare with. The question asks about the number of successful goals by players in yellow jerseys. Based on this single segment, it's unclear if the goal was successful or not. However, the presence of the attempt suggests at least one possible goal. Without further segments to confirm, the most conservative answer is to acknowledge the attempt and consider the possibility of one goal.\n</think>\n<answer>C</answer>", "answer": "C"}
