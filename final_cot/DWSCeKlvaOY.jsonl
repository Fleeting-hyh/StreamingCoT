The background shows the scenery outside the airplane window, suggesting the plane is in flight. Since this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we can only confirm that the pilot is engaged in steering at this moment. To determine how long she maintains this action until landing, we need to observe subsequent segments to see if she continues steering and when the landing occurs. \n\nGiven the options, we need to track the duration of her steering action across all segments to match it with the correct time frame.
