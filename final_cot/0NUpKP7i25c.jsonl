The subtitle The hardest banana to cutis visible at the bottom. The game involves cutting a banana, as indicated by the knife and banana on the screen. \n\nSince the question asks for the man's score when the time ran out, and the current score is only 9, it suggests that the game is still in progress. The options provided are all much higher than 9, indicating that the score will increase as the game continues. \n\nGiven that the score is only 9 at 13.16 seconds, it is unlikely that the final score will be as low as 207 or 307. The options 2070 and 217 are more plausible, but without further context or a later frame showing the final score, it is difficult to determine the exact score. However, based on typical game scoring patterns, a score in the range of 2000s is more likely than 200s or 300s.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible option is B, The man's score was 2070 when the time ran out.\n</think>\n<answer>B</answer>", "answer": "A"}
