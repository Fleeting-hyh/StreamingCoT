The girl is standing still, wearing a German Shepherd mask. There is no indication of her moving or performing any actions like clapping, dancing, running, or jumping. The dense caption confirms that she is standing behind the open door, and there is no mention of any movement or interaction from her side. This suggests that she remains stationary as the man approaches.
