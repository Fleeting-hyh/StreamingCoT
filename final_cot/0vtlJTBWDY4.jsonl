The man is eating his noodles with a fork, and there are two bottles of seasoning on the table. There is no indication of any bowl switching in this segment. \n\nSince there is no prior context or previous segments to refer to, we cannot determine any previous actions related to switching bowls. The question asks how many times the bowls were switched during the video, but based on the current segment alone, no switching has occurred.\n\nGiven the options, we need to consider that the video might not have shown any switching yet, or it might be incomplete.
