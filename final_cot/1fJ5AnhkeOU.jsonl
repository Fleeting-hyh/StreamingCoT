The video frames show a tree and dry grass, but no leopard is visible in this segment. \n\nGiven the question is about how long a leopard stays vigilant on a lower branch, and there is no visible leopard in this segment, it suggests that the leopard might not be present in this particular frame. This could mean that the leopard's vigilance duration is not captured in this segment, or the scene has already changed.\n\nSince there is no prior context or previous segments to refer to, and the current segment does not show a leopard, it is difficult to determine the exact duration of the leopard's vigilance.
