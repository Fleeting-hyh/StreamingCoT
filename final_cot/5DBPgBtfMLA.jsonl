Since this is the first segment and no other jellies have been shown, we can only confirm one jelly so far. There is no information about additional jellies in this segment, so we cannot determine the total number yet. However, based on the options provided, we can start eliminating choices that are too high. Option A (\"Five\") and Option C (\"Four\") seem unlikely with only one jelly observed. Option B (\"Three\") is also high considering only one jelly is seen. Option D (\"Two\") is plausible if another jelly is introduced later, but we need more information to confirm.
