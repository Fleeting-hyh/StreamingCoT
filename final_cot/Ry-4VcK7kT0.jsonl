The snake's motion appears to involve undulating or bending its body, which is characteristic of wriggling. This type of motion is typical for snakes as they navigate their environment. The dense caption mentions the snake is hanging on the fan, which aligns with the observed wriggling motion. There is no indication of twisting, slithering, or coiling in this specific frame, as the snake is suspended and not on a surface.
