The scoreboard shows Uruguay leading 4-2 against South Korea. This is the initial moment after Uruguay gained the lead, and his expression is consistent with a moment of relief or prayer.\n\nGiven the options, we need to determine how long this expression lasts. The dense caption indicates a specific moment, not a duration.
