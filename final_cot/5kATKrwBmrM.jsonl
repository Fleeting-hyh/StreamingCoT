The man in the green shirt and red shorts is sitting nearby, but he is not interacting with the float.

The question asks how many different people are seen interacting with <start>blue float in Frame26</start><bbox>[0.202, 0.549, 0.392, 0.171]</bbox>s throughout the video. Based on this segment alone, only one person has interacted with a <start>blue float in Frame26</start><bbox>[0.202, 0.549, 0.392, 0.171]</bbox>. However, the options provided do not include a choice for one person, so we need to consider the possibility of more interactions in subsequent segments.
