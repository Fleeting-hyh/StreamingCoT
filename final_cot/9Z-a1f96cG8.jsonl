The truck is the main object in the scene. The snowy road and snow-capped mountains in the distance are part of the environment, not distinct objects. The sky with heavy clouds is also part of the environment. There are no other distinct objects mentioned or visible in this segment. \n\nGiven the options, the question asks for the number of distinct objects involved in the scene. The truck is the only distinct object, while the rest are environmental elements. Therefore, Option A (One distinct object) is the most appropriate choice.\n</think>\n<answer>A</answer>", "answer": "B"}
