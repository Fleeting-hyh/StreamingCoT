She appears to be pausing momentarily before beginning to move again. The dense caption indicates she is in this position for the entire duration of the segment. Since the segment covers 1 second, and she is not moving, it suggests she is standing still for this brief period. \n\nGiven the options, we need to determine how long she stands facing left before moving again. The dense caption indicates she stands on one foot for the entire segment, but does not specify the exact time she faces left. \n\nConsidering the options provided and the brief duration of the segment, it seems unlikely that she stands for 11, 14, or 10 seconds based on this single segment.
