The scene shows him getting ready to descend, but no backflip is performed in this segment. Since this is the beginning of the video, there is no prior context to suggest any backflips have occurred yet. The question asks how many times the man successfully performs a backflip, and based on this initial segment, no backflips have been seen. Therefore, the options suggesting multiple backflips (A, B, C) are not supported by this segment. Option D suggests one backflip, but without seeing it happen, we cannot confirm this yet. Option Z remains a possibility if no backflips are observed throughout the video.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "A"}
