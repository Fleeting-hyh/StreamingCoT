The question asks about the number of strings cut and the final result. The options mention different numbers of strings cut and different outcomes involving water balloons bursting and splashing water on various individuals.\n\nGiven the initial setup, it's clear that the activity involves cutting strings to make the balloons burst. However, without further segments showing the progression of the activity, it's not possible to determine the exact number of strings cut or the final outcome. The dense caption does not provide information on the number of strings or the final result of the activity.\n\nSince the video segment provided does not show any strings being cut or balloons bursting, none of the specific outcomes described in the options can be confirmed.
