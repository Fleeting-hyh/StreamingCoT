Given the context of a prison setting, the equipment might be related to recreational activities within the facility. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there are no prior segments to compare with, I can only confirm the presence of one type of sports equipment here. There is no indication of other sports equipment like a baseball bat, golf balls, football, soccer ball, volleyball, or tennis rackets in this segment. Therefore, based on the information available, the options that mention multiple types of sports equipment cannot be confirmed yet.\n\nOption C mentions tennis balls and a soccer ball, but neither is visible in this segment.
