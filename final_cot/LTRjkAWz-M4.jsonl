The object has raised circles on it, and the part being held has a mesh pattern. The background is gray. The object appears to have lights that are illuminated in different colors, such as red and blue. \n\nSince this is the first segment, there is no prior context to compare with. The question asks about the number of different states of the light beam during the sequence of actions.
