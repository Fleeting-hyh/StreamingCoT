This is the first indication of liquid being poured into the molds. Since there is no prior context or additional frames provided, we can only confirm this single instance of liquid being poured. The question asks how many times liquid is poured into the molds throughout the video. Given the information from this segment alone, we can only account for one instance. However, the options provided do not include a single instance, so we need to consider the possibility that the video might show more instances in subsequent segments.
