The pendant is being displayed, but there is no indication of it being opened or adjusted in this segment. The focus is on showing the pendant itself. Since this is the first segment, there is no prior context to compare with. The question asks how many times the pendant is opened or adjusted throughout the video. Given that this segment only shows the pendant being held, no adjustments or openings are observed here.
