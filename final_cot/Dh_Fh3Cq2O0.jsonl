The sable antelope is drinking water, unaware of the lioness's presence. The lioness remains in a lowered position, indicating she is preparing for an attack. Given the options, the lioness's preparation time needs to be determined based on the video's duration and the actions observed. The dense caption confirms the lioness is in a lowered position, but the exact duration isn't specified. Since the video segment is only 1 second long, it's not possible to determine the full duration of the lioness's preparation from this segment alone.
