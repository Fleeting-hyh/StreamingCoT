This suggests the beginning of a braiding process. Since there's no indication of picking up additional strands yet, it\u2019s the initial step in creating a French braid. The video only shows the preparation of the initial strands, so no new strands have been picked up from the sides at this point. Given the question is about how many times new strands are picked up, this segment alone does not provide enough information to determine the answer fully.
