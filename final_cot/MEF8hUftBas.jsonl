The scissors are being used to cut the balloon. There is no indication of any other type of scissors being used in this segment. Since this is the first segment and no prior context is available, we can only confirm the presence of one type of scissors so far. The question asks about the total number of different types of scissors used throughout the video, but with only this segment, we can only confirm one type. Therefore, Option D (One type of scissors is used) is the most accurate based on the current information.\n</think>\n<answer>D</answer>", "answer": "A"}
