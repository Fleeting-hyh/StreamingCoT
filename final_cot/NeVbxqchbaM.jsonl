This confirms the presence of another luminous object interacting with its surroundings. Earlier, at [03-12], a thrown weapon landed in the lake, emitting a flash of light and deflecting a circular saw blade, causing trees to fall. This suggests that the thrown weapon and the circular saw blade are both luminous objects interacting with their environment. Additionally, at [12-20], a luminous object flew through a window and into a room, and at [20-29], it continued flying and collided with a fence, causing a person to run out with sparks and a colorful ring of light appearing.
