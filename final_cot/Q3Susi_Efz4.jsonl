This is the first object she uses to cover the food. The table is set with various dishes, and the background includes a blue wall with a green plant and an elephant figurine. There is no indication of any other objects being used to cover the food in this segment. Since this is the only object mentioned and shown in the current segment, we can infer that she has used at least one object. Without additional segments showing more objects, the most accurate choice based on the current information is that she used one object. However, since the options do not include one,we need to consider the possibility that more objects might be introduced in subsequent segments. For now, based on the current segment alone, the closest option that does not contradict the information is 'B' (Two), assuming there might be another object introduced later.\n</think>\n<answer>B</answer>", "answer": "D"}
