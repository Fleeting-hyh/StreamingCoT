This is the first head type observed in the video. Since there is no prior context or additional head types mentioned in this segment, we can only confirm one distinct head type so far. The question asks for the total number of distinct head types throughout the video, but with only one segment analyzed, we can't confirm more than one type. Therefore, we need to consider the options based on the information available. Option C (Two distinct head types appear throughout the video.) and Option D (Three distinct head types appear throughout the video.) are not supported by the current evidence. Option A (Four distinct head types appear throughout the video.) and Option B (Five distinct head types appear throughout the video.) also cannot be confirmed yet.
