There is no indication of flames being sprayed from the object in this segment. The dense caption confirms the presence of a golden object but does not mention any flames. Since the question asks about the duration of flames being continuously sprayed, and this segment does not show any flames, it suggests that the flames are not present in this part of the video. Therefore, the duration of flames being continuously sprayed cannot be determined from this segment alone. \n\nGiven the options, none of them can be confirmed based on this segment alone, as it does not show flames being sprayed.
