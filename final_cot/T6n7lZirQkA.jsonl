The <start>woman in Frame25</start><bbox>[0.462, 0.392, 0.916, 0.779]</bbox> has black paint on one of her hands.

This leaves us with Option A, which states that the <start>woman in Frame25</start><bbox>[0.462, 0.392, 0.916, 0.779]</bbox> repeats the order but doesn't receive any feedback on the screen.
