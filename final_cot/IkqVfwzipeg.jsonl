Their presence or absence in the frame is crucial for determining the correct time range when the camera action occurs. Removing this entity would negate the ability to confirm the camera's zooming out action as described in the question. The camera zooming out action is directly related to the change in the visual perspective that includes the rear wheel and rear suspension of the mountain bike. This action is the catalyst for the visual change that the question is asking about. Without the camera zooming out,the rear wheel and rear suspension would not be shown,thus directly affecting the conclusion.
