Given the context of the question, which asks how many balloons were cut open throughout the video, this segment shows the preparation to cut one balloon. \n\nSince there is no prior context or additional segments provided, we can only confirm the action of cutting one balloon in this segment. The options provided include various numbers of balloons cut open, but without further segments to analyze, we can only account for the one balloon being cut in this specific frame.\n\nTherefore, based on the current segment alone, we cannot definitively choose an option that specifies multiple balloons being cut open.
