There are no traffic signals or any flashing lights visible in this frame. Since this is the first segment and there is no prior context or previous segments to refer to, we cannot confirm any appearances of traffic signals or railway signals yet. The question asks about the number of times these signals appear and flash, but based on this segment alone, no such events have occurred.
