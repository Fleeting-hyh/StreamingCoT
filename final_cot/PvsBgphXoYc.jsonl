The object appears to be expanding and contracting. Given the short duration of the segment, it's challenging to determine the exact number of expansions and contractions. However, based on the visible motion, it seems the object expands and contracts once within this timeframe. The dense caption mentions the object being held and manipulated, which aligns with the observed action.
