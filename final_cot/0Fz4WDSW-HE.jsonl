A woman in white clothes stands behind them. The scene shows two people directly involved in making the young man glide with the kite: the young man and the man in black. The woman in white is present but not directly involved in the action of gliding with the kite. This eliminates options A and B, as they suggest more people are involved. Option D is incorrect because it implies only one person is involved, but there are clearly two. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as it accurately reflects the two people directly involved.\n</think>\n<answer>C</answer>", "answer": "C"}
