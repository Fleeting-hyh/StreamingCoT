This is the first boat observed in the video. The dense caption confirms the presence of this boat. Since this is the only segment provided, there is no evidence of additional boats in this timeframe. The question asks about the number of unique boats visible over the course of the video. Given the information from this segment, only one unique boat is visible. There is no indication of any other boats in the current segment, so Option A seems plausible. However, without additional segments to confirm or contradict this, we must rely on the current evidence.\n</think>\n<answer>A</answer>", "answer": "D"}
