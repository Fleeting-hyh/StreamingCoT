The man appears to be checking the woman's compliance with the dress code before allowing her to enter. \n\nGiven the question asks how many different people are involved in the sequence leading up to the woman entering the room, we need to consider if there are any other people involved. The dense caption mentions two young men in black suits, but only one is visible in this frame. \n\nSince the dense caption mentions two young men, but only one is visible, it suggests there might be another man involved.
