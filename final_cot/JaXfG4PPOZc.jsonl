Since the current segment only shows the cars parked and not departing, it doesn't provide information on how many will leave. The options need to be considered based on the potential for multiple vehicles to depart, but without seeing them leave, it's uncertain. Option A suggests four vehicles, which is possible given the initial setup, but without seeing them depart, it's speculative. Option Z (\no right option) might be considered if the video doesn't show any vehicles leaving.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "C"}
