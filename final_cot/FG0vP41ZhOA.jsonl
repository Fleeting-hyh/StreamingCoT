This is the first bridge mentioned. The dense caption for the current segment mentions passing two more bridges, which suggests that there are at least three bridges encountered so far. However, the question asks for the total number of bridges passed until reaching the sea, and the dense caption indicates that two more bridges can be seen in the distance.\n\nGiven the information, the orange kayak has passed under at least three bridges, and there are two more bridges visible ahead.
