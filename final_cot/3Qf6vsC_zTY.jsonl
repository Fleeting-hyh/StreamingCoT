The text \"DISE\u00d1OS DE SONRISA\" suggests a focus on smile designs. There is no indication of any facial transformation occurring in this segment. The question asks about the number of different facial transformations in the video. Since no transformations are observed in this segment, we need to consider if any transformations occur in subsequent segments to determine the correct answer.
