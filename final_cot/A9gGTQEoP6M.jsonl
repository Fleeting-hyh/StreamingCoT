The question asks for the duration the fighter maintains control without interruption. The options suggest different time frames, and based on the single frame, I can't determine the exact duration yet.\n\nGiven the lack of interruption in the visible frame, I need to consider if any option matches a scenario where the control is maintained without interruption. However, without additional frames or context, I can't definitively choose among the options A, B, C, or D. Thus, the safest choice is Z, as there isn't enough information to confirm any specific duration.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "C"}
