This would be visible and likely mentioned in the dense caption if it were the case.\n\nOption C involves a magnet inside the cob and her necklace.

This would also likely be visible and mentioned if it were the case.\n\nGiven the lack of visible tools or objects other than her hands and the <start>corn cob in Frame1</start><bbox>[0.537, 0.493, 0.104, 0.167]</bbox>, Option A seems the most plausible, as it doesn't require additional visible equipment and aligns with common magic tricks involving strings.\n</think>\n<answer>A</answer>", "answer": "B"}
