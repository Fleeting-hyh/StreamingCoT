The scene also shows three women dancing on a cracked glacier stage with a cartoon character dancing on a screen behind them, which matches Option D. Additionally, another man is seen playing the bass, and a red graphic appears, which is consistent with Option D.\n\nComparing this with the previous segment, where the man runs onto the stage and gestures to the audience, it further supports Option D as the correct sequence of actions.
