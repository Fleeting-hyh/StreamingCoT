The phone case is transparent with sparkling sequins and a three-dimensional pink peach. The word Washappears in a black border with white text. This indicates the first text caption in the video. \n\nSince this is the first segment and no prior context is available, we can only confirm the presence of the Washcaption. The question asks about the number of different text captions and their timing throughout the entire video. \n\nGiven the options, we need to consider the possibility of additional captions appearing later.
