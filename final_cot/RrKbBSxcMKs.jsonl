The action of sewing is just beginning, and the rip is not yet covered. Given that the process of sewing a rip typically takes more than a few seconds, it's unlikely that the entire rip will be covered in just 1 second. The dense caption confirms the initial action but doesn't provide information on the completion time. \n\nSince the video segment is only 1 second long and the sewing process is just starting, it's clear that the entire rip will not be covered in this short time frame.
