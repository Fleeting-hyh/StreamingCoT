He is sitting on a foam cushion and holding the tape with one hand. This is the initial step in the process of sticking and removing the tape from his legs. The dense caption confirms that he is preparing to tear the tape, which suggests that the actual process of sticking and removing the tape has not yet begun. \n\nGiven that the process has not started in this segment, we cannot yet determine the total time it will take.
