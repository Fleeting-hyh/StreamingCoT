{"Timestamp": "1 second", "key_items": [], "explanation": "<think>\nAt [0-1], the boy is seen striking a running pose inside the snack shop. The environment has white walls, beige tile flooring, snack-filled shelves, and a black monitor in the background. The next part of the video isn't shown, but based on the context and the question, we need to determine the duration until the camera zooms in on his smiling face. Since the segment only covers the initial moment of the boy running, we lack the full context to determine the exact duration. However, the options suggest a specific timeframe, and without further visual evidence, we can't confirm the exact duration.
