The text overlay suggests a humorous context about leaving class before presentations. However, the video is blurry, making it difficult to count distinct layers of participants engaging in dancing. Given the lack of clarity and the absence of visible dancing actions, it's challenging to determine the number of layers. The dense caption mentions multiple participants, but without clear visual evidence of dancing, it's hard to confirm any specific number of layers. Therefore, the best choice is to acknowledge that there's no right option based on the visible information.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "C"}
