The papaya is cut in half, revealing the flesh and seeds inside.

However, the video does not provide information on the growth timeline of the papaya plant from seed to developing seven leaves. The dense caption mentions AMAZING TUBE timelapse,which might suggest a time-lapse of the growth process, but the current segment only shows the seed extraction.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about the growth period in the current segment, I cannot confirm the exact number of days required for the papaya plant to develop seven leaves.
