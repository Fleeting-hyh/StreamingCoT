The number 2is visible in the middle, which might indicate a timer or a score. There is no indication of any dribbling action occurring in this segment. The players are stationary, and no movement past an opponent is observed. Given that the question asks about successful dribbling past an opponent, and no such action is visible in this segment, it suggests that the player in the purple jersey has not yet dribbled past an opponent.
