She is wearing glasses, a floral top, and a blue checkered apron, with purple hair rollers in her hair. The background shows white cabinets. This segment focuses on her preparing the rice, which is likely part of the process of making Pok Ball rice balls. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we can't determine the total time spent on making the Pok Ball rice balls and presenting them to the girl with chips. However, the initial action of scooping rice suggests the beginning of the process. \n\nGiven the options, we need to consider the entire process, including making the rice balls and presenting them.
