The scoreboard on the right side of the frame shows a score of 3/8. This is the first time the scoreboard is visible in the video segment provided. There are no other instances of the scoreboard being shown in this segment, so the score of 3/8 is only displayed once here. \n\nGiven the options, the question asks how many times the scoreboard shows a score of 3/8 during the video. Since the segment only shows the scoreboard once with this score, and there is no prior context indicating it was shown before, the most accurate answer is that it is shown one time in this segment.\n</think>\n<answer>D</answer>", "answer": "C"}
