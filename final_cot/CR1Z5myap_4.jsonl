The road curves, and the car appears to be stationary or moving slowly. There are no indications of the car changing direction in this segment. The black car is parked on the right side of the road with two people standing nearby.

The question asks how many times the <start>blue car in Frame5</start><bbox>[0.363, 0.339, 0.198, 0.051]</bbox> changes direction from one side to the other throughout the video.
