He holds a roll of yellow tape and a bag of white powder. There is an inset image showing a hand reaching towards something. This setup suggests a single scene without switching, focusing on the man and his actions.\n\nSince this is the first segment and there's no prior context, I cannot determine any scene switches yet. The question asks how many times the scene switches occur throughout the video, but with only this segment, I can't confirm any switches. The options provided will need to be considered as the video progresses to identify any changes in scenes.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "B"}
