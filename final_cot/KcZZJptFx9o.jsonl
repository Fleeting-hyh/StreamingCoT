This aligns with the sequence described in Option A, which includes slicing off the white edges and cutting off the bottom. The current segment continues this process by cracking the top to reveal the meat and water, pouring out the water, flattening the top, and scraping the meat.\n\nOption A encompasses all these steps, including the initial removal of the green outer skin, cutting and shaping the top, polishing with a grinder, slicing off the white edges, cutting off the bottom, showing the smooth <start>coconut in Frame28</start><bbox>[0.5, 0.541, 0.993, 0.912]</bbox>, cracking the top to reveal the meat and water, pouring out the water, flattening the top, scraping the meat, and finally refilling and sealing with plastic wrap. \n\nOption B does not cover the initial steps of removing the green outer skin and polishing with a grinder.
