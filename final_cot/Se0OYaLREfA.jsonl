This is the first Lamborghini observed in the video. There are no other Lamborghinis visible in this segment. The dense caption confirms the presence of only one Lamborghini in this scene. Since this is the first segment and no prior context is available, we can only confirm the presence of one Lamborghini so far. The options provided suggest multiple Lamborghinis, but based on the current information, we cannot confirm more than one.
