This aligns with the current segment where the white lamb is on the wooden pile and the black and white lamb is on the grass. There is no indication in the current segment that the black and white lamb climbs onto the wooden pile or that the white lamb jumps off.\n\nOptions B, C, and D suggest changes involving the black lamb or black and white lamb taking the position on the wooden pile, but the current segment does not show these changes.
