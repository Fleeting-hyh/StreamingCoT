The video title mentions the \"SEARAM THE INSANE PHALANX MISSILE LAUNCHER,\" but there is no visible missile launch occurring in this segment. The focus is on the launcher itself with the ocean and sky in the background. Since there is no indication of a missile being launched in this segment, we can't confirm any launches here. \n\nWithout prior context or additional segments, we can't determine the total number of launches throughout the entire video.
