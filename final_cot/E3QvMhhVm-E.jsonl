The background shows a field of yellow grass, and there are no other workers visible in this frame. \n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context or additional workers observed, it suggests that only one worker is involved in the brick-laying process at this point. The question asks how many different workers are involved throughout the entire video, but with only this segment, we can only confirm the presence of one worker. \n\nGiven the options, none of them indicate that only one worker is involved. Therefore, without additional segments showing more workers, the best choice is to select Zas there is no right option based on the current information.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "D"}
