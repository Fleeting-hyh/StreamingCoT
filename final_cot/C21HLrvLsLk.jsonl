This is the first instance of the stunt shown in the video. The dense caption mentions the man riding a bicycle on a curved ramp, which aligns with the action observed in the frame. Since this is the first segment and no prior context is available, we can only confirm this single instance of the stunt. \n\nGiven the options, we need to determine how many times this stunt is shown throughout the video. Since we only have evidence of one instance in this segment, we cannot confirm any of the options that suggest multiple instances (A, B, C, D).
