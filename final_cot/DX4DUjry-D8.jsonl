One lion is already in the middle of the river, while two lions are closer to the riverbank, seemingly preparing to cross. The river is rushing, indicating a strong current, which might affect the lions' ability to cross. The lush green grass on the riverbank suggests a natural habitat for these lions. \n\nGiven the question about how many lions successfully cross the river, we need to observe if all three lions make it across. The dense caption mentions a lion in the river, but it doesn't specify if all lions successfully cross. \n\nSince the video only shows the lions starting to cross and doesn't provide further information on their success, we can't confirm if all three lions make it across.
