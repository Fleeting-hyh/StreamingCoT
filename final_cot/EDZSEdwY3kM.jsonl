A tool is being used to interact with the brush, likely drilling holes in the ferrule. Since the video only shows the initial action, it's unclear how many holes are drilled in total. The dense caption confirms the presence of the brush and the action taking place, but without further context or additional frames, it's impossible to determine the total number of holes drilled throughout the entire process.
