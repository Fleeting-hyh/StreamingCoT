This is the first interaction observed in the video. The scene includes a large red can and a tube-like object, but the character does not interact with these objects through jumping. The question asks for the number of different objects the character interacts with through jumping before the scene starts to rewind. Since only one interaction is observed in this segment, and no prior context is available, we need to consider the possibility of additional interactions in subsequent segments. However, based on the current segment alone, the character interacts with only one object.
