At [36-40], a worker used a rolling tool to form the seaweed into cylindrical shapes. At [27-36], a machine applied yellow liquid to the seaweed sheet. At [18-22], a red roller machine sprayed water and white powder onto the seaweed. At [10-18], a machine cut the seaweed sheets, and at [7-10], a machine was used for initial processing. These segments collectively indicate the use of different machines for various stages of processing, including rolling, cutting, spraying, and transporting. The conveyor system adds to the count, confirming the involvement of five different machines.
