These two signs already accounted for flashing red lights.\n\nNow, with the skull\u2019s red flashing eye in the current segment, we have three objects exhibiting flashing red lights: the two railroad crossing signs and the skull.\n\nGiven the options, 'A' states that three objects exhibit flashing red lights during their movement, which matches our observation.
