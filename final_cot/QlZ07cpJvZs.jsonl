At [00-01], it was white.\n\nThis adds another white background, but it's a repeat of the earlier white background, so it doesn't count as a new distinct background. Therefore, the total number of distinct backgrounds remains six. Given the options provided, none reflect a cumulative total of six backgrounds.
