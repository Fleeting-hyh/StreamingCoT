{"Timestamp": "1 second", "key_items": ["red arrow symbol"], "explanation": "<think>\nAt [0-1], the video shows a rat in a narrow, dark space with a red arrow pointing to a specific area. The red arrow appears once in this segment. Since this is the first segment and no prior context is available, I can only confirm the presence of the red arrow once so far. To determine the total number of times the red arrow appears, I need to consider subsequent segments. However, based on the current information, the red arrow has appeared once.
