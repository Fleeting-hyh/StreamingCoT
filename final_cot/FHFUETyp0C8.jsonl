The man is watching her, and there is no indication of a horizontal split or any dramatic jump. The woman uses a shoe on her hand, which suggests she might be demonstrating flexibility or humor. The scene does not show her completing a real vertical split or any yoga moves. This aligns with the idea that she is pretending to do a vertical split using the shoe, which fits with Option D.
