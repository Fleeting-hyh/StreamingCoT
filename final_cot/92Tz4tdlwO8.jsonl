The sign is positioned on a green meadow with trees and a blue sky in the background. This is the first sign observed in the video. Since this is the only sign seen so far, it's not possible to determine the total number of signs or their relative sizes based on the number displayed. The options provided suggest different numbers of signs and relationships between the numbers and sizes.
