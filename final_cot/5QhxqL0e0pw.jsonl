This is the first interaction observed in the video. Since there is no prior context or previous segments to compare with, we can only confirm this single interaction at this point. The question asks how many different icons are physically interacted with by the man throughout the video. Given that only one interaction is observed in this segment, we can eliminate options that suggest more than one interaction.
