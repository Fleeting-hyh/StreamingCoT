The dense caption confirms that the chimpanzee is looking down at the ground, indicating movement. Since the video segment is only one second long, it's not possible to determine the full duration of the movement from this segment alone. However, the question asks for the total time spent moving to the right on all fours. Given the options, we need to consider the duration mentioned in each choice. Option D states that the chimpanzee spends 4 seconds moving to the right on all fours, which is a plausible duration based on typical chimpanzee movement speed and the context provided. Options A and C mention 4 seconds but involve different directions or upright running, which do not match the observed movement. Option B suggests 6 seconds, which is longer and not supported by the current segment. Therefore, Option D is the most consistent with the observed movement in the segment.\n</think>\n<answer>D</answer>", "answer": "D"}
