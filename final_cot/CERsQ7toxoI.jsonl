The scene is set outside a door, and the boy appears to be using the racket to prevent them from entering. The dense caption confirms that the boy is using the racket to block them outside the door. \n\nGiven the timestamps provided, the action of blocking with the racket occurs within the first second. The question asks how long the boy uses the racket to block their faces before closing the door. Since the action is observed only in the first second, it suggests a very short duration.\n\nOptions A, B, and D suggest longer durations (10, 8, and 6 seconds respectively), which are inconsistent with the observed action. Option C suggests 4 seconds, which is also longer than what is observed. Therefore, none of the options accurately reflect the observed duration.\n\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "D"}
