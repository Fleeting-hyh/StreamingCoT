The scene is set in a water park with a clear view of the slide and surrounding area. The caption mentions the presence of these individuals, but it doesn't show anyone sliding down yet. Since the question asks how many people slide down by the end of the video, and this segment only shows them preparing, we need to consider future segments to determine the answer. However, based on the initial setup, it's clear that multiple people are present, which could lead to multiple people sliding down.
