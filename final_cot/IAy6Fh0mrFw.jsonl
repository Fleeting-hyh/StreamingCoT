In segment [15-21], the camera showed the lighthouse from above with waves surrounding a stone pillar beside it, reinforcing the dangerous conditions.\n\nGiven these observations, the video depicts three distinct states: a calm sea with no waves, large waves hitting the lighthouse, and dangerous conditions with spray covering the lighthouse. This aligns with Option D, which mentions these three states.\n\nOption A and B suggest more states than observed, and Option C includes states not depicted in the video. Option Z is unnecessary as Option D accurately describes the states shown.\n</think>\n<answer>D</answer>", "answer": "B"}
