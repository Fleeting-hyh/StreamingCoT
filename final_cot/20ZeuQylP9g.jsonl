The background shows a blue sky with white clouds and some buildings and trees in the distance. There are five emojis at the top of the screen. Since this is the first segment and no other young men have been observed, it suggests that only one young man has appeared so far. The question asks how many distinct young men appear throughout the video, and based on the current segment, only one young man is visible.
