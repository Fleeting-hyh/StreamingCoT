So far, we have only seen one throw. Without additional segments showing more throws, we cannot confirm the total number of throws beyond this point. However, based on the information available, the <start>shovel in Frame22</start><bbox>[0.557, 0.575, 0.265, 0.305]</bbox> has been thrown once.\n\nConsidering the options provided, Option D (\"The <start>shovel in Frame22</start><bbox>[0.557, 0.575, 0.265, 0.305]</bbox> is thrown once\") aligns with the observed action in this segment.\n</think>\n<answer>D</answer>", "answer": "C"}
