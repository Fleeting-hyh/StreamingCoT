Therefore, we cannot determine the exact duration from this segment alone. However, we can eliminate options that suggest a duration longer than what is visible in this segment. Option A (four seconds) and Option B (five seconds) are not possible as the segment only covers one second. Option D (two seconds) is also not possible as the boy is still on the <start>dog's back in Frame0</start><bbox>[0.553, 0.734, 0.357, 0.359]</bbox>.
