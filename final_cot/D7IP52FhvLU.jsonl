There is no indication yet of the man changing spots to dig. The dense caption confirms they are preparing to dig for the treasure, but without movement or change in location, we cannot determine any spot changes. \n\nGiven that the video has just started and the question asks about how many times the man changes spots to dig during the video, it's too early to confirm any changes. We need to observe further segments to see any movement or relocation by the man.\n\nAt this stage, there's no evidence of any spot changes, so options A, B, C, and D are not yet supported.
