There is no mention of him using a combination of hand spreading and folding in front of his body in this segment. Since this is the first segment and no prior context is available, we cannot confirm any previous actions. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot determine how many times he uses this combination. The options suggest specific counts, but without observing the full video, we cannot accurately choose between them. Thus, the best choice is to indicate that there is no right option based on the current information.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "B"}
