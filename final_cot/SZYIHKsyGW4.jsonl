Since the train is not present in this segment, we cannot determine the door's open duration from this frame alone. \n\nGiven that there is no prior context or previous segments to refer to, we cannot confirm or eliminate any options based on the current information. The dense caption mentions the hallway and its features but does not provide details about the train or its door.
