The dense caption indicates that the fighters are in an octagon-shaped cage, but it does not mention any pinning action. Since the video only shows the fighters in a standing position and no pinning is observed, it suggests that the Black fighter did not keep his opponent pinned to the ground during this segment. Therefore, the options suggesting a pinning duration (A, B, C, D) are not supported by the current segment. The most appropriate choice is Z, indicating no right option is available based on the observed actions.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "D"}
