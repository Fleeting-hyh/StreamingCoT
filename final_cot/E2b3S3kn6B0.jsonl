He appears to be preparing to throw the ball but then uses his racket to hit it instead. This action is consistent with the description of a Crazy tennis glitch trickshot.\n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we can only confirm this action once. The question asks how many times he performs this trick throughout the video. Given that we only have evidence of one occurrence in this segment, we cannot yet determine the total number of times he performs the trick. However, we can eliminate options that suggest a higher frequency based on this single segment alone.\n\nOptions A, C, and D suggest multiple occurrences, which we cannot confirm yet.
