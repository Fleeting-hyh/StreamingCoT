This initial state is crucial for understanding the transformation he undergoes. The question asks about a distinct state change and the immediate action taken after this transformation. \n\nGiven the options, we need to identify which state change and subsequent action match the description. The options involve gaining wings, legs, arms, or eyes, followed by specific actions. \n\nSince the dense caption mentions Speakerman has only one arm initially, gaining both arms would be a significant state change.
