The screen shows a Windows desktop with various application icons. This indicates that the man is in the process of repairing or assembling the display. Since the question asks how many <start>LED panel in Frame22</start><bbox>[0.58, 0.338, 0.831, 0.674]</bbox>s the man installed to complete the display, and we only see one panel being installed in this segment, we need to consider if this is the only panel or part of a series. Given the options, we need to determine if the video shows multiple installations or just one. The dense caption mentions a missing <start>LED panel in Frame22</start><bbox>[0.58, 0.338, 0.831, 0.674]</bbox>, suggesting that more than one panel might be needed to complete the display. However, without seeing the entire process, it's challenging to confirm the exact number.
