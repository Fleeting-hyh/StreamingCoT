The dense caption describes him grabbing the bottom of the can with his left hand and placing his right hand on top. This suggests he is either opening the can or attempting to get chips out. Given the context of the question, which involves getting chips out, attempting to get his hand unstuck, and shaking the can, this initial interaction is part of the overall process.\n\nSince this is the first segment and there is no prior context, we can only confirm the start of the interaction.
