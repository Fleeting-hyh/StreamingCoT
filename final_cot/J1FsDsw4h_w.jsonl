The setup includes a tic-tac-toe plate and golden objects on the table. The caption indicates a prize of $100 for the winner. Since this is the first segment, there's no prior context to compare with. The question asks how many times the man in gray successfully makes his bottle stand throughout the video. Without seeing the entire video, it's impossible to determine the exact number of successful attempts. However, based on the initial setup and the presence of the prize, it suggests a competitive element.
