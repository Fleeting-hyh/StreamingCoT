They are positioned in a line, and none of them have their arms raised above their heads. This is the first segment, so there is no prior context to compare with. The question asks how many times the girls raise their arms above their heads throughout the video. Since no arms are raised in this segment, we can start counting from zero. \n\nGiven that this is the first segment and no arms have been raised yet, we can eliminate options that suggest higher frequencies of arm-raising, such as 'Three times' (A), 'Four times' (B), and 'Five times' (C). The option 'Two times' (D) is still possible, but we need more segments to confirm.
