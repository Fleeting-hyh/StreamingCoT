A large piece of driftwood is also present inside the tank. The scene shows the algae starting to increase noticeably on the driftwood. \n\nGiven the question asks how many hours have passed when the algae on the driftwood start to increase noticeably, we need to consider the typical growth rate of algae in such an environment. Algae growth can vary depending on several factors like light exposure, nutrient levels, and water conditions. However, the options provided give specific time frames which we need to evaluate.\n\nSince the dense caption and the video frame show the algae increase, we need to consider the most plausible time frame for noticeable algae growth. Algae can grow relatively quickly under favorable conditions, but 16, 14, 18, or 20 hours are all within a reasonable range. However, 16 hours is often cited as a common period for noticeable algae growth in aquariums under optimal conditions.\n\nTherefore, based on typical algae growth patterns and the provided options, Option A (16 hours) seems the most plausible.\n</think>\n<answer>A</answer>", "answer": "A"}
