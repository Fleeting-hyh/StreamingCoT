{"Timestamp": "1 second", "key_items": [], "explanation": "<think>\nAt [0-1], Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Captain America are sitting on toilets in a bathroom. Iron Man is raising both hands to the right, while Spider-Man and Captain America have their hands on their knees. This is the first observed position for all three characters. There are no changes in position or orientation noted within this segment. Since there are no prior segments to compare with, we cannot yet determine how many times they change their positions. The dense caption confirms their initial setup but does not indicate any movement or change yet.
