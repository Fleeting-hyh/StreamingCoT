He appears to be preparing to use it. Since this is the first segment, there is no indication yet of how many times he tears off the tape. The dense caption mentions he is holding the tape, but no action of tearing it off is described in this segment. Therefore, we cannot determine the number of times he tears off the tape from this segment alone. We need to observe more segments to count the instances.\n</think>\n<answer>Z</answer>", "answer": "C"}
